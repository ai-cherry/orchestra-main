# Service Account Access Configuration

## Attribute Selection and Value

Yes, "repository" is the correct attribute to choose for GitHub Actions. This corresponds to the attribute mapping we set up earlier:

```
attribute.repository = assertion.repository
```

For the attribute value field, enter your GitHub repository in the format:

```
ai-cherry/orchestra-main
```

Replace "ai-cherry/orchestra-main" with your actual GitHub organization/username and repository name.

## Complete Configuration

1. **Service Account**: codespaces-powerful-sa (or whichever service account you want to use)

2. **Attribute Name**: repository

3. **Attribute Value**: ai-cherry/orchestra-main (your GitHub repo)

This configuration allows GitHub Actions workflows running in the specified repository to impersonate the service account and access Google Cloud resources.

## Explanation

When you set up the Workload Identity Provider, you created an attribute mapping that maps the GitHub repository claim to the "attribute.repository" attribute. Now, you're creating a binding that says "GitHub Actions workflows from this specific repository can impersonate this service account."

The attribute condition you set up earlier (`attribute.repository=='ai-cherry/orchestra-main'`) ensures that only workflows from your specific repository can use this identity provider. This binding further restricts which service account those workflows can impersonate.

## GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

After completing this setup, update your GitHub Actions workflow to use this configuration:

```yaml
- id: auth
  name: Authenticate to Google Cloud
  uses: google-github-actions/auth@v1
  with:
    token_format: 'access_token'
    workload_identity_provider: 'projects/525398941159/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-wif-pool/providers/github-actions'
    service_account: 'codespaces-powerful-sa@cherry-ai-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
```

Make sure to replace:
- `525398941159` with your actual GCP project number
- `github-wif-pool` with your actual Workload Identity Pool name
- `github-actions` with your actual Provider ID
- `codespaces-powerful-sa@cherry-ai-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with your actual service account email
