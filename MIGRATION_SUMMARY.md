# GCP Project Migration and Hybrid IDE Setup - Final Solution

This repository contains a complete solution for migrating the "cherry-ai-project" project to the "cherry-ai" organization and setting up a hybrid IDE environment with Redis/AlloyDB memory layer and Gemini Code Assist integration.

## Available Migration Approaches

We have provided multiple approaches to accomplish the migration, each with different levels of automation and control:

### 1. Fully Automated Script: `migrate_and_setup.sh`

This all-in-one script automates the entire migration process from start to finish. It:
- Automatically installs required tools (gcloud, Terraform) if not present
- Handles GCP authentication using service account credentials
- Performs the project migration to the new organization
- Sets up the Redis/AlloyDB memory layer
- Deploys Cloud Workstations using Terraform

To use:
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x migrate_and_setup.sh

# Run
./migrate_and_setup.sh
```

**Best for**: Development or test environments where quick setup is preferred over manual control.

### 2. Step-by-Step Approach: `real_migration_steps.sh`

This script provides a structured approach with detailed steps that you can execute one by one, verifying success after each step. It:
- Outlines each command with explanations
- Includes verification steps after critical operations
- Provides troubleshooting guidance
- Allows for manual control of the migration process

To use:
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x real_migration_steps.sh

# View the steps and execute them section by section
./real_migration_steps.sh
```

**Best for**: Production environments where careful control and verification is required.

### 3. Phased Migration: `phased_migration.sh`

For high-stakes environments, this script breaks the migration into discrete phases with checkpoints between each phase. It:
- Segments the migration into 5 logical phases
- Creates persistent checkpoints to resume interrupted migrations
- Provides a dry-run option to simulate without making changes
- Includes confirmation prompts between phases

To use:
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x phased_migration.sh

# Run in dry-run mode first
./phased_migration.sh --dry-run

# Execute each phase individually
./phased_migration.sh --phase=1
./phased_migration.sh --phase=2
# etc.
```

**Best for**: Mission-critical production environments with zero tolerance for errors.

## Validation and Verification

After migration, verify its success with the validation script:

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x validate_migration.sh

# Run validation
./validate_migration.sh
```

This script performs comprehensive tests on all migration components and provides a detailed report.

## Documentation

For detailed information on requirements and processes, refer to:

- **`MIGRATION_REQUIREMENTS.md`**: Lists all prerequisites, permissions, and quotas
- **`GCP_MIGRATION_README.md`**: Provides detailed explanations of the migration process
- **`HYBRID_IDE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`**: Offers guidance on the hybrid IDE environment

## Infrastructure as Code

The Terraform configuration files included:

- **`hybrid_workstation_config.tf`**: Comprehensive configuration for Cloud Workstations with optimized settings for AI development

## Execution Order for Production Deployment

For a production migration, we recommend the following approach:

1. Review all documentation and prerequisites in `MIGRATION_REQUIREMENTS.md`
2. Complete the pre-migration checklist
3. Run `phased_migration.sh --dry-run` to simulate the migration
4. Execute each phase individually, validating after each step:
   ```bash
   ./phased_migration.sh --phase=1
   ./validate_migration.sh
   
   ./phased_migration.sh --phase=2
   ./validate_migration.sh
   
   # Continue with remaining phases
   ```
5. Verify the final state using `validate_migration.sh`

For non-production environments, the simpler `migrate_and_setup.sh` script might be sufficient.
