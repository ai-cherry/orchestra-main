- Test disaster recovery procedures

**Key Activities:**
1. Execute end-to-end test suite against staging environment:
   ```bash
   ./gcp_migration/run_e2e_tests.sh --env=staging
   ```
2. Conduct load testing on critical services:
   ```bash
   ./gcp_migration/performance_benchmark.py --compare-with=baseline
   ```
3. Perform security penetration testing
4. Test disaster recovery scenarios:
   ```bash
   ./gcp_migration/test_recovery.sh --scenario=service_failure
   ```

**Success Criteria:**
- All test cases pass in GCP environment
- Performance meets or exceeds baseline
- No critical security vulnerabilities identified
- Successful recovery from simulated disasters

### Phase 6: Cutover and Go-Live (Week 4, Days 1-2)

**Objectives:**
- Execute production migration
- Update DNS and traffic routing
- Perform final verification
- Monitor system behavior

**Key Activities:**
1. Execute final production data synchronization

## Rollback Procedures

A detailed rollback plan is established for each migration phase. The key rollback procedures include:

### Infrastructure Rollback

```bash
./gcp_migration/rollback.sh --phase=infrastructure --env=production
```

### Data Rollback

```bash
./gcp_migration/rollback.sh --phase=data --env=production
```

### Service Rollback

```bash
./gcp_migration/rollback.sh --phase=services --env=production
```

### Complete Rollback

```bash
./gcp_migration/rollback.sh --complete --env=production
```

## Error Management

The comprehensive error resolution toolkit is in place to address issues during migration:

1. **Automated Detection**: Continuous monitoring for critical issues
2. **Rapid Diagnosis**: MCP Server Diagnostics tool identifies root causes
3. **Systematic Resolution**: Migration Error Resolver implements fixes
4. **Documentation**: Incident reports capture all issues and resolutions

For critical errors:

```bash
./gcp_migration/migration_error_manager.sh --log-dir=/var/log/migration
```

- **Database Specialists** (2): Data migration and validation
- **Application Engineers** (3): Service deployment and testing
- **Security Engineer**: Security validation and compliance
- **QA Team** (2): Testing and validation

### Timeline

The complete migration is scheduled over 4 weeks:
