# AI Orchestra GCP Migration Implementation

This document provides complete information about the GCP migration toolkit implementation for the AI Orchestra project. It includes architecture, components, usage instructions, and deployment guidelines.

## Overview

The AI Orchestra GCP Migration Toolkit is a comprehensive solution designed to facilitate the migration of the AI Orchestra project to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It handles environment detection, configuration management, memory optimization, circuit breaker patterns for resilience, and detailed monitoring and reporting.

### Key Components

1. **MCP Client** (`mcp_client.py`): A robust client for interacting with the MCP server across all environments
2. **Hybrid Configuration** (`hybrid_config.py`): Environment-aware configuration management
3. **Circuit Breaker** (`circuit_breaker.py`): Implementation of the circuit breaker pattern for resilient service calls
4. **Migration Monitor** (`migration_monitor.py`): Monitoring, reporting, and alerting for migration progress
5. **Migration Management** (`manage_migration.sh`): A shell script for orchestrating the entire migration process

## Architecture

The toolkit follows a layered architecture:

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│  Migration Manager Script  │
└───────────────┬────────────┘
                │
┌───────────────▼────────────┐
│    Migration Monitor       │
└───────────────┬────────────┘
                │
┌───────────────▼────────────┐

```

Each component is designed to be independently usable while integrating seamlessly with the others.

## Detailed Component Documentation

### MCP Client (`mcp_client.py`)

The MCP client provides a robust interface for interacting with the Memory Control Protocol (MCP) server. It features:

- Environment detection for automatic configuration
- Graceful degradation when the `requests` package is unavailable
- Synchronous and asynchronous operation support
- Proper error handling and logging

**Basic Usage:**

```python
from gcp_migration.mcp_client import get_client

# Get the default client
client = get_client()

# Store data
client.set("my_key", {"data": "value"})

# Retrieve data
data = client.get("my_key")
print(data)
```

### Hybrid Configuration (`hybrid_config.py`)

The hybrid configuration system provides environment-aware configuration management, detecting whether the code is running in local development, GitHub Codespaces, GCP Cloud Workstation, or production Cloud Run. It features:

- Automatic environment detection
- Configuration file and environment variable support
- Service endpoint resolution based on environment
- Default configuration generation

**Basic Usage:**

```python
from gcp_migration.hybrid_config import get_config

# Get the configuration
config = get_config()

# Get configuration value with default
api_key = config.get("api_key", "default-key")

# Get service endpoint
api_endpoint = config.get_endpoint("admin-api")
```

### Circuit Breaker (`circuit_breaker.py`)

The circuit breaker pattern implementation provides resilience for service calls, particularly useful for resource-intensive operations like vector search. It features:

- Configurable failure threshold and recovery timeout
- Function decorators for both synchronous and asynchronous functions
- Class-level registry of circuit breakers
- Detailed state tracking and reporting

**Basic Usage:**

```python
from gcp_migration.circuit_breaker import circuit_break

# Regular function with circuit breaker
@circuit_break(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=30.0)
def call_external_service(param):
    # This function will be protected by the circuit breaker
    return external_api_call(param)

# Async function with circuit breaker
from gcp_migration.circuit_breaker import async_circuit_break

@async_circuit_break(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=30.0)
async def call_async_service(param):
    # This function will be protected by the circuit breaker
    return await external_api_call_async(param)
```

### Migration Monitor (`migration_monitor.py`)

The migration monitor tracks progress across all phases and generates detailed status reports. It features:

- Phase status tracking (not started, in progress, completed, failed, skipped)
- Detailed metrics collection
- Markdown report generation
- Command-line interface for status updates

**Basic Usage:**

```python
from gcp_migration.migration_monitor import get_monitor, MigrationPhase

# Get the monitor
monitor = get_monitor()

# Record phase start
monitor.phase_started(MigrationPhase.CORE_INFRASTRUCTURE)

# ... perform migration ...

# Record phase completion
monitor.phase_completed(
    MigrationPhase.CORE_INFRASTRUCTURE,
    success=True,
    details={"resources_created": 10}
)

# Generate report
report_path = monitor.generate_report()
```

## Migration Process

The migration is divided into the following phases:

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Sets up the foundational GCP resources
2. **Workstation Configuration**: Configures Cloud Workstations for development
3. **Memory System**: Optimizes vector storage and retrieval
4. **Hybrid Config**: Deploys environment-aware configuration
5. **AI Coding**: Configures AI coding assistants (Gemini)
6. **API Deployment**: Deploys and optimizes Cloud Run services
7. **Validation**: Validates the migration against performance targets

Each phase can be executed and verified independently, with detailed reporting on progress and issues.

## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) installed and configured
- Access to target GCP project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-orchestra.git
   cd ai-orchestra
   ```

2. Make the management script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x gcp_migration/manage_migration.sh
   ```

### Initial Setup

## Configuration

### Environment-specific Configuration

Configuration is stored in JSON files in the `config` directory:

- `common.json`: Settings shared across all environments
- `local.json`: Local development settings
- `codespaces.json`: GitHub Codespaces settings
- `workstation.json`: GCP Cloud Workstation settings
- `cloud_run.json`: Production Cloud Run settings

### Environment Variables

You can override configuration using environment variables with the `ORCHESTRA_` prefix:

- `ORCHESTRA_PROJECT_ID`: GCP project ID
- `ORCHESTRA_LOCATION`: GCP location
- `ORCHESTRA_ENV`: Deployment environment
- `ORCHESTRA_CONFIG_DIR`: Configuration directory

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**

   ```
   Error: Could not find default credentials
   ```

   Solution: Run `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`

2. **Missing Dependencies**

   Solution: Install required packages with:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Environment Detection Issues**

   Solution: Manually specify the environment:
   ```bash
   export DEPLOYMENT_ENV=production
   ```

4. **Permission Denied**

   Solution: Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x gcp_migration/*.sh
   ```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with the migration toolkit, please:

1. Check the logs in `./logs/migration`
2. Run with `--verify-only` to test without making changes
3. Contact the AI Orchestra team for assistance

## Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: The MCP client masks API keys in logs to prevent accidental exposure
2. **Authentication**: Always use Workload Identity Federation (WIF) in production
3. **Permissions**: Follow principle of least privilege for service accounts
4. **Configuration**: Don't store sensitive information in configuration files

## Extending the Toolkit

### Adding New Migration Phases

1. Add the phase to the `MigrationPhase` enum in `migration_monitor.py`
2. Implement the execution and verification logic in `execute_unified_migration.py`
3. Update the documentation to reflect the new phase

### Custom Metrics

To add custom metrics for monitoring:

```python
from gcp_migration.migration_monitor import get_monitor

monitor = get_monitor()
monitor.record_metric("MEMORY_SYSTEM", "query_latency_ms", 25.4)
monitor.record_global_metric("total_resources", 157)
```

## Performance Optimizations

The migration toolkit includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures during high load
2. **Environment-aware Configuration**: Optimizes settings based on environment
3. **Connection Pooling**: Efficiently reuses connections for MCP operations
