## Parallel Development Strategy

During the migration process, development will continue using the following approach:

1. **Phased Migration**: Migrate one component at a time while keeping others operational
2. **Feature Freezes**: Implement brief feature freezes during critical transition phases
3. **Dual-Running Systems**: Run both old and new systems in parallel during transition
4. **Testing Windows**: Allocate dedicated testing periods after each phase
5. **Rollback Procedures**: Maintain ability to revert to previous infrastructure at each step

## Rollback Procedures

Each phase includes automated rollback procedures in case of critical issues:

1. **Infrastructure**: Terraform state rollback to previous configuration
2. **Workstations**: Snapshot-based restoration of development environments
3. **Memory System**: Database point-in-time recovery with transaction logs
4. **API Services**: Blue/Green deployment with instant traffic redirection
5. **Complete Rollback**: Full system restoration from backups if necessary

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Performance degradation | Low | High | Comprehensive benchmarking before cutover |
| Data loss during migration | Very Low | Critical | Multiple backup strategies and validation |
| Developer workflow disruption | Medium | Medium | Phased approach with parallel systems |
| Integration failures | Medium | High | Thorough testing after each phase |
| Cost overruns | Low | Medium | Regular budget reviews and optimization |
| Service interruptions | Low | High | Blue/Green deployment approach |
