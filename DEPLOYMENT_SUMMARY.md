# Orchestra AI Deployment Summary

**Date:** June 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Partially Complete

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Roo Configuration Complete
- Successfully configured 10 specialized modes with OpenRouter models
- Created rules directories for each mode
- Updated MCP configuration
- Committed and pushed to GitHub main branch
- Repository: https://github.com/ai-cherry/orchestra-main

### 2. ⚠️ MCP Server Status
- MCP server has dependency issues (missing imports in orchestrator_server.py)
- Module is installed but the server code needs fixes
- Server attempted to start but failed due to import errors

### 3. ⚠️ API Server Status
- API server has code issues (FastAPI parameter validation errors)
- The `/api/agents` endpoint returns 404
- Server needs code fixes before it can run properly

### 4. ⚠️ Admin UI Build Status
- Dependencies installed successfully with pnpm
- Build failed due to TypeScript errors (43 errors in 14 files)
- Issues mainly related to:
  - Missing properties in PersonaStore
  - Type mismatches in React components
  - Unused imports

### 5. ✅ Infrastructure Status
- Nginx is running and serving content
- Domain https://cherry-ai.me is accessible (returns 200 OK)
- Sites available: default, orchestra, orchestra-admin

## Current Access Points
- **Domain:** https://cherry-ai.me (currently serving existing content)
- **Server:** 45.32.69.157
- **Nginx:** Active and running

## Next Steps Required

1. **Fix API Code Issues:**
   - Resolve FastAPI parameter validation errors in `agent/app/routers/llm.py`
   - Fix import issues in the API routers

2. **Fix MCP Server:**
   - Update `mcp_server/servers/orchestrator_server.py` to fix import errors
   - Ensure all required functions exist in agent_control module

3. **Fix Admin UI TypeScript Errors:**
   - Update PersonaStore to include missing properties
   - Fix React component type issues
   - Remove unused imports

4. **Complete Deployment:**
   - Once code is fixed, restart API server
   - Build Admin UI successfully
   - Deploy built assets to nginx

## Commands for Future Deployment

```bash
# Fix and restart API
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn agent.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Build Admin UI (after fixing TypeScript errors)
cd admin-ui
pnpm build
cp -r dist/* /var/www/orchestra-admin/

# Restart services
systemctl reload nginx
```

## Repository Status
All Roo configurations have been successfully committed to GitHub:
- Commit: feat: Complete Roo configuration with 10 specialized modes and MCP integration
- Branch: main
- Status: Pushed successfully

The infrastructure is ready, but the application code needs fixes before full deployment can be completed.
