# üîç **AI CLEANUP REVIEW PROMPT**

## **Mission: Comprehensive Code Review**

You are an expert software engineer tasked with reviewing a **massive 3-phase repository cleanup** of the Orchestra AI project. Please conduct a thorough review for bugs, issues, and potential problems.

## üìä **Cleanup Summary (What Was Done)**

### **Phase 1: Initial Cleanup (280ae1e)**
- **173 files removed** (~400k lines deleted)
- Removed all `fix_*` scripts (34 files)
- Removed all date-stamped files from 2025 (debug reports, status files)
- Removed root-level `test_*` files
- Removed `cleanup_*`, `debug_*`, `scan_*` files
- Removed most `check_*` files (kept `check_required_apis.sh`)
- Removed backup files and empty directories

### **Phase 2: Deeper Cleanup (b9bbf77)**
- **139 files removed** (~32k lines deleted)
- Cleaned root-level .md files: 122 ‚Üí 22 files
- Removed temporary documentation (status reports, implementation guides, deployment docs)
- Removed all JSON report files (58 files)
- Removed all log/pid files
- Removed audit directories: `audit_results_20250605/`, `.migration_backups/`, `.refactoring_backups/`

### **Phase 3: Smart Cleanup (5c2b649 + b371a61)**
- **22 files changed** (critical fixes)
- **Removed `venv/` from git tracking** (134MB no longer tracked)
- Enhanced `.gitignore` with Python/Node.js best practices
- Removed 7 duplicate requirements files
- Removed duplicate environment files
- Deleted `archives/` directory
- Consolidated Docker config (removed `docker-compose.prod.yml`)

### **Total Impact**
```
üî• Total Files Removed: 335+ files
üìâ Total Lines Deleted: ~432,000 lines
üõ°Ô∏è Security Vulnerabilities: 108 ‚Üí 24 (77% reduction!)
üíæ Repository Size: Dramatically reduced
```

## üéØ **Review Checklist**

### **üö® CRITICAL AREAS TO CHECK**

#### **1. Deployment Impact**
- [ ] Are all essential deployment files still present?
- [ ] Is `docker-compose.production.yml` complete and functional?
- [ ] Are required environment files (`.env.production`, `.env.example`) intact?
- [ ] Will the current deployment continue to work?

#### **2. Application Functionality**
- [ ] Are core application files untouched?
- [ ] Is the admin interface (`admin-interface/`) fully functional?
- [ ] Are API endpoints (`production-api/`) preserved?
- [ ] Are database configurations intact?

#### **3. Dependencies & Requirements**
- [ ] Is the main `requirements.txt` comprehensive?
- [ ] Are module-specific requirements files appropriate?
- [ ] Will Python dependencies install correctly?
- [ ] Are any critical packages missing?

#### **4. Git Configuration**
- [ ] Is `.gitignore` properly configured?
- [ ] Are `venv/` and `node_modules/` correctly ignored?
- [ ] Are any important files accidentally ignored?
- [ ] Is git history clean and meaningful?

### **üîç SPECIFIC FILES TO VERIFY**

#### **Essential Files That Should Exist:**
- [ ] `README.md` - Main documentation
- [ ] `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- [ ] `docker-compose.production.yml` - Deployment config
- [ ] `.env.production` - Production environment
- [ ] `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- [ ] `prometheus.yml` - Monitoring config

#### **Application Core That Should Be Intact:**
- [ ] `admin-interface/` - React admin dashboard
- [ ] `production-api/` - FastAPI backend
- [ ] `core/` - Core application logic
- [ ] `shared/` - Shared utilities
- [ ] `scripts/` - Essential scripts

#### **Configuration Files:**
- [ ] Database configuration files
- [ ] API routing and middleware
- [ ] Authentication systems
- [ ] Monitoring and logging setup

### **üêõ BUG PATTERNS TO LOOK FOR**

1. **Broken Import Statements**
   - Check for removed modules still being imported
   - Verify relative import paths are correct

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Look for references to removed requirements files
   - Check for hardcoded paths to deleted files

3. **Configuration Drift**
   - Ensure environment variables are consistent
   - Verify Docker configs reference existing files

4. **Service Integration Issues**
   - Check if services reference deleted files
   - Verify inter-service communication paths

5. **Deployment Gaps**
   - Ensure all needed scripts for deployment exist
   - Check if startup sequences reference deleted files

## üö® **Red Flags to Watch For**

- Any references to deleted `fix_*` scripts in remaining code
- Import statements pointing to removed modules
- Hardcoded paths to deleted directories
- Docker services referencing removed files
- Broken relative paths after file removal
- Missing critical environment variables
- Incomplete database configurations

## üìã **Review Format**

Please provide:

1. **‚úÖ PASSED ITEMS** - What looks good
2. **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS** - Potential issues that need attention  
3. **üö® CRITICAL ISSUES** - Must-fix problems
4. **üí° RECOMMENDATIONS** - Suggested improvements
5. **üîß ACTION ITEMS** - Specific fixes needed

## üéØ **Priority Questions**

1. **Will the application start and run correctly?**
2. **Are all deployment scripts functional?**
3. **Are there any broken dependencies?**
4. **Is the cleanup too aggressive anywhere?**
5. **Are there any security implications from the changes?**
