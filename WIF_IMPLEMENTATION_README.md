# Workload Identity Federation (WIF) Implementation

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of the Workload Identity Federation (WIF) enhancement plan for the AI Orchestra project. It includes tools for vulnerability remediation, migration from service account keys to WIF, CI/CD pipeline modernization, and team training.

## Features

- **Vulnerability Management**: Scan for vulnerabilities, prioritize them, update dependencies, and verify fixes
- **Migration Management**: Prepare environment, create backups, run migration scripts, and verify success
- **CI/CD Pipeline Management**: Identify pipelines, analyze authentication methods, create templates, and update pipelines
- **Training Management**: Develop materials, set up knowledge base, conduct sessions, and collect feedback
- **Database Integration**: Store and retrieve vulnerability information and implementation plan progress
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly interface for executing and monitoring the implementation plan
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for executing the implementation plan

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ai-cherry/orchestra-main.git
   cd orchestra-main
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r wif_implementation_requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

To execute the implementation plan from the command line:

```bash
./wif_implementation_cli.py --phase vulnerabilities
```

Available phases:

- `vulnerabilities`: Address Dependabot vulnerabilities
- `migration`: Run migration script
- `cicd`: Update CI/CD pipelines
- `training`: Train team members
- `all`: Execute all phases (default)

Additional options:

- `--verbose`: Show detailed output during processing
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be done without making changes
- `--report PATH`: Path to write the report to

Example:

```bash
./wif_implementation_cli.py --phase vulnerabilities --verbose --report vulnerability_report.md
```

### Web Interface

To start the web interface:

```bash
./wif_implementation_web.py
```

Then open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000

Additional options:

- `--host HOST`: Host to bind to (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `--port PORT`: Port to bind to (default: 8000)
- `--reload`: Enable auto-reload

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=wif_implementation tests/
```

## Implementation Plan

The implementation plan consists of four phases:

### Phase 1: Vulnerability Remediation

1. Create an inventory of all vulnerabilities
2. Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and impact
3. Update direct dependencies
4. Address transitive dependencies
5. Run security scans
6. Verify application functionality

### Phase 2: Migration

1. Prepare the environment for migration
2. Create backups of the current state
3. Run the migration script in development
4. Verify migration success in development
5. Run the migration script in production
6. Verify migration success in production
7. Update documentation
8. Clean up legacy components

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Modernization

1. Identify all CI/CD pipelines
2. Analyze authentication methods
3. Create template pipelines
4. Update service-specific pipelines
5. Test pipeline execution
6. Monitor production deployments

### Phase 4: Team Training

1. Develop training materials
2. Set up a knowledge base
3. Conduct technical sessions
4. Conduct hands-on workshops
5. Establish a support period
6. Collect feedback and improve

## API Reference

The web interface provides a REST API for interacting with the implementation plan:

- `GET /api/tasks`: Get all tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/{task_name}`: Get a task by name
- `GET /api/vulnerabilities`: Get all vulnerabilities
- `GET /api/vulnerabilities/{vulnerability_id}`: Get a vulnerability by ID

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add my feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-feature`
5. Submit a pull request
