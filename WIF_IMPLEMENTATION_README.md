# Streamlined Workload Identity Federation Implementation

This document provides an overview of the streamlined Workload Identity Federation (WIF) implementation for the AI Orchestra project.

## Overview

Workload Identity Federation (WIF) allows GitHub Actions to authenticate with Google Cloud Platform without using service account keys. This implementation provides a unified and consistent approach to setting up and using WIF in the AI Orchestra project.

## Files

The following files have been created or updated:

1. **`setup_wif.sh`**: A unified script for setting up Workload Identity Federation
   - Creates a Workload Identity Pool
   - Creates a Workload Identity Provider for GitHub
   - Creates a service account with necessary permissions
   - Sets up the binding between GitHub Actions and the service account
   - Sets up GitHub repository secrets

2. **`verify_wif_setup.sh`**: A script for verifying the WIF setup
   - Checks if all required GitHub secrets are set
   - Verifies that the Workload Identity Pool and Provider exist
   - Checks if the service account has the necessary permissions
   - Verifies that the workload identity binding is set up correctly

3. **`.github/workflows/wif-deploy-template.yml`**: A template for GitHub Actions workflows using WIF
   - Includes proper authentication with Workload Identity Federation
   - Provides a complete CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying to Cloud Run
   - Supports different environments (dev, staging, prod)

4. **`docs/WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_FEDERATION.md`**: Comprehensive documentation for WIF
   - Explains what WIF is and its benefits
   - Provides step-by-step instructions for setting up WIF
   - Explains how to use WIF in GitHub Actions workflows
   - Includes troubleshooting guidance

5. **`migrate_to_wif.sh`**: A script to help users migrate to the new WIF implementation
   - Backs up old scripts
   - Makes new scripts executable
   - Provides guidance for transitioning to the new implementation

## Migration

To migrate to the new WIF implementation, run the migration script:

```bash
./migrate_to_wif.sh
```

This script will:
1. Back up all old scripts with `.updated` suffixes
2. Make the new scripts executable
3. Optionally remove the old scripts
4. Provide guidance for using the new implementation

## Usage

### Setting Up WIF

To set up Workload Identity Federation:

```bash
./setup_wif.sh
```

You can customize the setup with various options:

```bash
./setup_wif.sh --help
```

### Verifying WIF Setup

To verify that WIF is correctly set up:

```bash
./verify_wif_setup.sh
```

### Using WIF in GitHub Actions

1. Copy the template to create a new workflow:

```bash
cp .github/workflows/wif-deploy-template.yml .github/workflows/your-service-deploy.yml
```

2. Customize the workflow for your service:
   - Update the service name
   - Update the service path
   - Customize build and test commands
   - Adjust deployment parameters

## Benefits of the New Implementation

The streamlined WIF implementation provides several benefits:

1. **Simplified Setup**: A single script handles the entire setup process
2. **Consistent Approach**: All components follow the same patterns and conventions
3. **Comprehensive Verification**: Easily verify that everything is set up correctly
4. **Clear Documentation**: Detailed documentation for all aspects of WIF
5. **Easy Migration**: Simple migration from the old implementation

## Next Steps

After migrating to the new WIF implementation:

1. Review the comprehensive documentation at `docs/WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_FEDERATION.md`
2. Run the verification script to ensure everything is set up correctly
3. Update your GitHub Actions workflows to use the new template
4. Remove any references to the old scripts in your documentation and processes
