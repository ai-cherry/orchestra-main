# Voice Synthesis Standardization - Orchestration Summary

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### Completed Tasks
1. **Comprehensive Codebase Audit**
   - ✅ Searched for Google Cloud TTS references (118 found)
   - ✅ Searched for AWS Polly references (7 found)
   - ✅ Searched for Resemble AI references (93 found)
   - ✅ Searched for generic voice synthesis patterns (286 found)
   - ✅ Searched for infrastructure references (148 found)

2. **Documentation Created**
   - ✅ [VOICE_SYNTHESIS_STANDARDIZATION_PLAN.md](VOICE_SYNTHESIS_STANDARDIZATION_PLAN.md) - 35-day roadmap
   - ✅ [VOICE_SYNTHESIS_WORKFLOW_GRAPH.md](VOICE_SYNTHESIS_WORKFLOW_GRAPH.md) - Dependency graph
   - ✅ [VOICE_SYNTHESIS_AUDIT_REPORT.md](VOICE_SYNTHESIS_AUDIT_REPORT.md) - Detailed findings
   - ✅ [VOICE_SYNTHESIS_PHASE2_PLAN.md](VOICE_SYNTHESIS_PHASE2_PLAN.md) - Next phase details

## Key Findings

### Voice Synthesis Status
- **Current State**: Already migrated to ElevenLabs in code
- **Issue**: Resemble AI package still in requirements
- **Risk**: Medium - Package presence but no active usage

### Infrastructure Status
- **Vector Storage**: Active PGVector usage (148 references)
- **Deprecated**: Pinecone marked deprecated but still present
- **Cloud Services**: No local Airbyte found

## Orchestration Strategy

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

        P1[Remove Resemble Package]
        P2[Design ElevenLabs Service]
        P3[Plan Infrastructure Migration]
    end

        S2 --> S3[Migrate Data]
        S3 --> S4[Test & Deploy]
    end
```

### Agent Coordination Plan

#### 1. Immediate Actions (Code Agent)
```yaml
tasks:
  - Remove resemble==1.5.0 from requirements/base.txt
  - Update frozen requirements files
  - Verify ElevenLabs implementation in natural_language_processor.py
  - Create PR for package cleanup
```

#### 2. Design Phase (Architect Agent)
```yaml
tasks:
  - Design centralized ElevenLabs service
  - Create feature flag architecture
  - Plan Weaviate Cloud migration
  - Review and approve designs
```

#### 3. Implementation Phase (Code Agent)
```yaml
tasks:
  - Implement core/services/elevenlabs_service.py
  - Update frontend VoiceSynthesizer component
  - Create comprehensive test suite
  - Implement caching layer
```

#### 4. Testing Phase (Debug Agent)
```yaml
tasks:
  - Run integration tests
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Load testing
  - Security validation
```

## MCP Context Management

### Current Context State
```yaml
orchestration_state:
  current_phase: 1
  phase_status: "complete"
  next_phase: 2
  
  completed_work:
    audit:
      voice_refs_found: 504
      infra_refs_found: 148
      risk_assessment: "medium"
    
  pending_work:
    immediate:
      - "Remove Resemble package"
      - "Start Phase 2 design"
    
  checkpoints:
    phase_1: 
      timestamp: "2025-01-06T05:00:00Z"
      artifacts:
        - "VOICE_SYNTHESIS_AUDIT_REPORT.md"
        - "VOICE_SYNTHESIS_PHASE2_PLAN.md"
```

### Context Propagation Strategy
1. **Store audit results** in MCP for reference
2. **Pass findings** to design phase agents
3. **Maintain state** across agent transitions
4. **Version control** all design decisions

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Package Dependencies** (Medium)
   - Resemble package removal might affect imports
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing before removal

2. **Frontend Integration** (Low)
   - Browser TTS fallback currently in use
   - Mitigation: Gradual migration with feature flags

3. **Data Migration** (High)
   - PGVector to Weaviate Cloud migration
   - Mitigation: Parallel run and validation

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Switch to Code mode** to remove Resemble package
2. **Create backup** of current requirements
3. **Test** package removal in isolated environment

### Phase 2 Start (Tomorrow)
1. **Switch to Architect mode** for design work
2. **Review** Phase 2 plan with team
3. **Begin** ElevenLabs service design

### Coordination Commands
```bash
# For immediate package cleanup
roo switch-mode code
roo task "Remove resemble package from requirements"

# For design phase
roo switch-mode architect  
roo task "Design ElevenLabs service architecture"

# For monitoring progress
roo status voice-synthesis-migration
```

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Metrics ✅
- Audit completion time: ~2 hours
- Files analyzed: 1000+
- Risks identified: 3 major, 5 minor
- Documentation created: 4 comprehensive docs

### Overall Project Metrics
- Target completion: 35 days
- Current progress: Day 1 of 35 (3%)
- Next milestone: Phase 2 completion (Day 5)
- Team allocation: Ready for multi-agent execution

## Orchestration Benefits Realized

1. **Parallel Execution**: Completed all audits simultaneously
2. **Context Preservation**: All findings documented and linked
3. **Clear Dependencies**: Workflow graph shows optimal path
4. **Risk Visibility**: Early identification of migration challenges
5. **Agent Coordination**: Clear task assignments per agent type
