# Troubleshooting GCP Service Account Key Authentication Error

I'm trying to authenticate with a GCP service account key but getting an "Invalid JWT Signature" error. Please help me diagnose and fix this issue.

## Service Account Details
- Service Account Email: codespaces-powerful-sa@cherry-ai-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- Service Account ID: 117958005088425650597
- Project ID: cherry-ai-project

## Error Message
When running `gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=credentials.json`, I get:
```
ERROR: (gcloud.auth.activate-service-account) There was a problem refreshing auth tokens for account codespaces-powerful-sa@cherry-ai-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com: ('invalid_grant: Invalid JWT Signature.', {'error': 'invalid_grant', 'error_description': 'Invalid JWT Signature.'})
```

## Key File Format
The key file is in JSON format and contains all the required fields:
- type
- project_id
- private_key_id
- private_key
- client_email
- client_id
- auth_uri
- token_uri
- auth_provider_x509_cert_url
- client_x509_cert_url

## What I've Tried
1. Verified the key file is valid JSON
2. Checked that the private key appears to be properly formatted
3. Confirmed the service account exists in the project

## Questions
1. What are the most common causes of "Invalid JWT Signature" errors?
2. How can I check if the private key in my credentials file is properly formatted?
3. Could this be related to the service account being disabled or the key being revoked?
4. Are there any organization policies that might be restricting service account key usage?
5. What's the best way to fix this issue - should I create a new key or is there a way to fix the existing one?
6. Is there a way to test the key directly with the Google OAuth API to bypass gcloud?

## Goal
I'm trying to deploy an MCP server to Cloud Run using this service account. Any help diagnosing and fixing this authentication issue would be greatly appreciated.
