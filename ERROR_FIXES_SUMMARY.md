# Error Fixes Summary

## Spelling Issues
The spelling issues for technical terms like "alloydb", "SSOT", etc. are now fixed with a `.cspell.json` file that adds these terms to the VS Code spell checker dictionary. The file is located at `/workspaces/orchestra-main/.cspell.json` and contains the following words:

- alloydb
- ALLOYDB
- SSOT
- ssot
- levelname
- xread

## Terraform Errors

### 1. Secret Manager Replication
The `automatic = true` attribute in the Secret Manager replication block was invalid. This has been fixed in the file `/workspaces/orchestra-main/gcp_migration/terraform/main.tf` by changing it to use `user_managed` replicas:

```terraform
replication {
  user_managed {
    replicas {
      location = "us-central1"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Persistent Directories Block
The `persistent_directories` block with `gcePd` or `gce_persistent_disk` was causing errors because the available provider version didn't support these syntax. The block has been commented out and replaced with a note to use alternative methods like GCS buckets or boot disk size increase:

```terraform
# Removing persistent_directories due to compatibility issues with current provider version
# For persistent storage, use GCS buckets with gsutil mount or increase boot disk size
# Host configuration has boot_disk_size_gb already configured to 50GB
```

## Recommendations

1. **For spell checking**: When adding new technical terms to your codebase, consider adding them to the `.cspell.json` file to prevent spell checker warnings.

2. **For Terraform**: Make sure you're using the correct syntax for your provider version. If you need persistent storage for your workstations:
   - Consider using a larger boot disk
   - Mount GCS buckets at runtime using `gsutil`
   - Upgrade the Terraform provider if possible (check latest documentation)

All errors reported in the original list have been fixed.
