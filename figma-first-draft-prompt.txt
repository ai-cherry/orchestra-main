Create a dark-themed tech command center aesthetic dashboard for Orchestra-Main at 1440px width. Use Inter as the primary font throughout the design.

Layout:
- Start with a dark background (#111827) for the main canvas

- Include a top navigation bar (height: 64px) with the Orchestra logo, page title, and user profile section
- Create a main content area with a 12-column grid system with 24px gutters
- Use 24px padding consistently around containers

Key Interface Elements:
1. Prompt Hub (Position: Span 8 columns on top row)
   - Create a prominent card with input field and action buttons
   - Include placeholder for recent/saved prompts below input area

2. Unified Chat Feed (Position: Span 8 columns below Prompt Hub)
   - Design a scrollable feed area with message bubbles
   - Include system vs. user attribution with timestamps
   - Show different message states (loading, error, complete)

3. Active Agents List (Position: Span 4 columns top-right)
   - Create status cards for 4-5 agents
   - Include agent icon, name, status indicator (active/idle), and action menu

4. System Health Card (Position: Below Active Agents, span 4 columns)
   - Include placeholder for uptime chart (line graph)
   - Add key metrics display with colored status indicators

5. LLM Token Gauge (Position: Bottom-right corner, span 4 columns)
   - Create a circular or horizontal progress gauge
   - Display current usage, limit values and percentage

Visual Style:
- Use #8B5CF6 (purple) as the primary accent color
- Apply subtle card shadows (drop shadow with 20% opacity)
- Include subtle grid background or dots on the main canvas for depth
- Use container radius of 8px consistently across cards
- Create clear visual hierarchy with consistent spacing between sections

Add realistic dummy data and placeholder charts where appropriate. Focus on creating a cohesive, professional interface that feels like a powerful AI command center.
