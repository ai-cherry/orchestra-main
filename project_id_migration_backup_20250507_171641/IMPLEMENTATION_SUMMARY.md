# Orchestra Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Orchestra's GCP authentication system, Terraform infrastructure provisioning, and Figma-GCP integration components.

## Components Implemented

### 1. GCP Authentication and Service Account Setup

- Created `setup_gcp_auth.sh` script to:
  - Configure GCP authentication 
  - Create and manage service account keys
  - Set up environment variables
  - Validate authentication

- Script supports the Vertex service account:
  ```bash
  export GCP_PROJECT_ID=agi-baby-cherry
  export GCP_SA_KEY_PATH=/tmp/vertex-agent-key.json
  export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/tmp/vertex-agent-key.json
  ```

### 2. Terraform Infrastructure Configuration

- Created complete configuration in `infra/orchestra-terraform/`:
  - Vertex AI Workbench (4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM)
  - Firestore in NATIVE mode with redundancy
  - Memorystore Redis instance (3GB)
  - Secret Manager for secure storage of credentials
  - Required API enablement

- Configuration uses variables for flexibility and environment-specific values:
  ```hcl
  variable "project_id" {
    description = "GCP Project ID"
    type        = string
    default     = "agi-baby-cherry"
  }
  ```

### 3. Figma-GCP Integration Components

- Developed `scripts/figma_gcp_sync.py` to:
  - Extract design tokens from Figma
  - Generate platform-specific style files (CSS, JS, Android, iOS)
  - Update GCP Secret Manager with design tokens
  - Validate using Vertex AI (optional)

- Supports automation through command-line parameters:
  ```bash
  python scripts/figma_gcp_sync.py \
    --file-key YOUR_FILE_KEY \
    --output-dir ./styles \
    --project-id agi-baby-cherry \
    --update-secrets \
    --validate
  ```

### 4. GitHub Integration

- Implemented `scripts/setup_github_org_secrets.sh` to:
  - Set up organization or repository secrets
  - Store GCP credentials securely
  - Configure Figma PAT for automated workflows

- Created GitHub Actions workflow templates for CI/CD:
  - Test execution
  - Figma synchronization
  - Deployment to Cloud Run

### 5. Memory Management Integration

- Created test scripts for memory management validation:
  - Local in-memory implementation testing
  - Firestore-based implementation testing
  - Error handling and recovery testing

## Unified Management Tools

### 1. Unified Setup Script

- Created comprehensive `unified_setup.sh` that:
  - Configures GCP authentication
  - Provisions infrastructure with Terraform
  - Sets up Figma-GCP integration
  - Configures GitHub Actions
  - Runs memory management tests

### 2. Unified Diagnostics

- Created `unified_diagnostics.py` that:
  - Checks environment variables
  - Validates GCP authentication
  - Verifies Terraform configuration
  - Tests Figma API connectivity
  - Validates GitHub Actions setup
  - Checks memory management functionality

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup

Run the unified setup script to configure all components:

```bash
./unified_setup.sh
```

This script will guide you through the entire setup process, with prompts for confirmation at critical steps.

### Diagnostics

Run the diagnostics script to check system health:

```bash
python unified_diagnostics.py
```

This will verify all components and provide a summary of the system status.

### Figma Synchronization

Sync design tokens from Figma:

```bash
python scripts/figma_gcp_sync.py --file-key YOUR_FILE_KEY
```

### GitHub Secrets Setup

Configure GitHub secrets for CI/CD:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token
./scripts/setup_github_org_secrets.sh --repo your_org your_repo
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Setup Script**: Execute `./unified_setup.sh` to set up the entire system
2. **Configure GitHub Webhooks**: Follow instructions in docs/github_webhook_setup.md
3. **Test Memory Management**: Run tests with GCP infrastructure
4. **Enable CI/CD Pipeline**: Configure GitHub repository for automated deployments

All components have been implemented according to the specified requirements and are ready for deployment.
