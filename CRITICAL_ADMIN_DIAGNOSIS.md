# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL DIAGNOSIS: Admin Website Deployment Issue

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### The Problem
**ALL recent Vercel deployments are FAILING with ERROR state**

### Evidence from Vercel API
1. **Latest Deployment**: `dpl_5soj3h9HUYcVXV4YKgmodCcsjbSW`
   - **State**: ERROR
   - **ReadyState**: ERROR
   - **URL**: orchestra-ai-admin-5alm43hv9-lynn-musils-projects.vercel.app

2. **Build Error**: 
   ```
   Error: Command "cd modern-admin && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build" exited with 1
   ```

3. **Rollup/Vite Build Failure**: The build is failing during the Vite compilation process

### What's Actually Live
The current working URL `https://modern-admin.vercel.app` is NOT from the recent deployments. It's from an older successful deployment that contains the static mockup.

### The Real Issue
1. **Build Process Failing**: All recent attempts to deploy the real admin interface are failing
2. **Old Deployment Still Live**: The static mockup is from an older, successful deployment
3. **No Real Backend Connection**: The mockup has hardcoded data because it can't connect to the real API

### Next Steps Required
1. Fix the build configuration in modern-admin
2. Resolve the npm/Vite build errors
3. Deploy the real functional admin interface
4. Connect it to the Lambda Labs backend API

## IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED
The admin website deployment has been broken for weeks because the build process is failing, not because of backend issues.
