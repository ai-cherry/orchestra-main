# MCP Final Status Report

## ✅ MCP is READY and CONFIGURED

### What I've Set Up:

1. **PostgreSQL Database** ✅
   - Running and configured with correct permissions
   - User: `orchestrator` 
   - Password: `orch3str4_2024`
   - Auto-starts on boot

2. **Weaviate Vector Database** ✅
   - Running via Docker
   - Accessible on port 8080

3. **MCP Servers** ✅
   - Configured and ready to be used by Cursor
   - Will start automatically when you use them in Cursor

4. **Automation** ✅
   - Services auto-check when you enter the directory
   - PostgreSQL auto-fixes permissions if needed
   - Helpful aliases: `orchestra-status`, `mcp-check`

### How MCP Works:

**Important**: MCP servers are NOT background services. They are started on-demand by Cursor when you use them.

### To Use MCP in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor in this project
2. In chat, type `@` to see MCP servers
3. Use commands like:
   - `@orchestra-memory store_memory "important decision"`
   - `@orchestra-memory search_memories "database"`

### Quick Commands:

```bash
# Check everything is running
orchestra-status

# View critical config (passwords, ports, etc)
cat CRITICAL_CONFIG.md

# View Cursor setup guide
cat CURSOR_MCP_SETUP.md
```

### What Happens Automatically:

1. When you open a new terminal in the orchestra directory:
   - Virtual environment activates
   - PostgreSQL is checked and fixed if needed
   - You see a helpful reminder

2. When you use MCP in Cursor:
   - Cursor starts the MCP server
   - It connects to PostgreSQL/Weaviate
   - Your commands are executed

### If Something Goes Wrong:

```bash
# Run the status check
orchestra-status

# Check PostgreSQL manually
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# Test PostgreSQL connection
PGPASSWORD=orch3str4_2024 psql -h localhost -U orchestrator -d orchestrator -c "SELECT 1;"
```

## The Bottom Line:

**MCP is ready to use**. Just open Cursor and start using `@orchestra-memory` and other MCP tools. Everything else is automated.
