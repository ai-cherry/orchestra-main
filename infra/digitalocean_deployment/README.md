# DigitalOcean Deployment Strategy for Orchestra AI

## Overview
Alternative deployment strategy using DigitalOcean Droplets instead of GCP, focusing on simplicity and CPU-based infrastructure.

## Current vs Proposed Architecture

### Current (GCP-based)
- **Compute**: Cloud Run, GKE
- **State**: GCS for Pulumi state
- **Secrets**: GCP Secret Manager
- **Framework**: Phidata + Custom Orchestrator

### Proposed (DigitalOcean-based)
- **Compute**: CPU Droplets (VMs)
- **State**: DigitalOcean Spaces or external
- **Secrets**: Pulumi ESC
- **Framework**: SuperAGI (requires migration)

## Migration Considerations

### 1. Framework Migration
- Current: Phidata-based agents
- Required: Port to SuperAGI or adapt current framework

### 2. Infrastructure Code
- Current: `pulumi_gcp` Python modules
- Required: `pulumi_digitalocean` modules

### 3. Service Dependencies
- ✓ DragonflyDB (Aiven) - Already compatible
- ✓ MongoDB Atlas - Already compatible
- ✓ Weaviate Cloud - Already compatible
- ✗ GCP-specific services need alternatives

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Minimal Migration (Recommended)
Keep your existing Phidata/MCP framework and deploy on DigitalOcean:

1. Create Pulumi DigitalOcean provider configs
2. Containerize existing orchestrator
3. Deploy without SuperAGI dependency
4. Use existing memory integrations

### Option 2: Full Migration
Adopt SuperAGI framework:

1. Port agent definitions from Phidata to SuperAGI
2. Migrate orchestration logic
3. Extensive testing required
4. Higher risk, longer timeline

## Cost Comparison

### GCP (Current)
- Cloud Run: ~$50-100/month (usage-based)
- GKE: ~$75/month (cluster management)
- Storage/Network: ~$25/month

### DigitalOcean (Proposed)
- Dev Droplet: $10/month (2GB/1vCPU)
- Prod Droplet: $48/month (8GB/2vCPU)
- Total: ~$58/month (fixed)

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | Stay with GCP | Move to DO |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Complexity | Higher | Lower |
| Cost | Variable | Fixed |
| Code Changes | None | Significant |
| GPU Support | Better | Limited |
| Existing Code | ✓ Works | Needs port |
| Team Expertise | ✓ Evident | Learning curve |

## Recommendation

**Stay with GCP** for now, but simplify:
1. Use Cloud Run exclusively (drop GKE)
2. Minimize service dependencies
3. Keep existing codebase
4. Monitor costs closely

If you must move to DigitalOcean:
1. Keep your framework (don't adopt SuperAGI)
2. Containerize existing code
3. Start with dev environment only
4. Gradual migration
