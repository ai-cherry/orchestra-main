# Deployment Status Analysis - June 14, 2025

## Current Status Summary

### ✅ Lambda Labs Backend - WORKING
- **URL**: http://150.136.94.139:8000/health
- **Status**: ✅ Healthy - Returns `{"status":"healthy","service":"orchestra-api","version":"2.0.0"}`
- **Orchestra AI**: ✅ Successfully deployed and running

### ❌ Vercel Frontend - FAILING
- **URL**: https://orchestra-main.vercel.app
- **Status**: ❌ 404 NOT_FOUND
- **Issue**: Vercel deployment is completely broken

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Vercel Build Configuration
The vercel.json is configured to build from `modern-admin/` but Vercel is not finding the application.

**Current vercel.json:**
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "cd modern-admin && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "modern-admin/dist"
}
```

### Problem 2: Missing Index File
Vercel expects an index.html in the output directory but the build may be failing.

### Problem 3: Build Process Issues
The build command may be failing during deployment, causing the 404.

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Vercel Build Process**
   - Ensure modern-admin builds correctly
   - Verify package.json and dependencies
   - Check build output directory

2. **Test Local Build**
   - Run build locally to verify it works
   - Check generated dist/ directory

3. **Redeploy to Vercel**
   - Push fixes to GitHub
   - Trigger new Vercel deployment

## Expected Resolution
Once Vercel frontend is fixed, the full-stack connection should work:
- Frontend: Vercel (modern-admin React app)
- Backend: Lambda Labs (Orchestra AI FastAPI)
- Proxy: Vercel serverless function connecting to Lambda Labs
