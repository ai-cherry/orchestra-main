# 📊 Status Update for Manus

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Live Collaboration**
   - WebSocket connection active at ws://cherry-ai.me:8765
   - Git sync working perfectly
   - DNS fully migrated to Lambda Labs

2. **Infrastructure**
   - All services running on Lambda Labs
   - cherry-ai.me accessible and healthy
   - Deployment scripts ready

## ⚠️ OpenRouter API Key Issue

The provided API key returns "401 Unauthorized":
```
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
```

**Please verify:**
- Is this the correct key?
- Has it been activated?
- Does it have credits?

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

Once we have a working API key:
1. `ai_assist.py` is configured and ready
2. Models selected based on your preferences
3. Deployment script ready to run

## 💡 Suggested Models

Since you wanted one model from your list, I recommend:
- **Claude Opus 4** (best for coding) 
- OR **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (proven to work)
- OR **GPT-4o-mini** (cost-effective)

Just need a working API key to proceed!
