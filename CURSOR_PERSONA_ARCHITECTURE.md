## 🔗 **CONNECTION POINTS**

### **Domain-Aware Code Intelligence**
Cursor provides contextualized coding assistance:

```python
# Pay Ready Domain - Financial/Payment Processing
# Business Logic: Managed by Sophia persona in production
# Database: pay_ready_financial_db  
# Compliance: PCI DSS Level 1 required
def process_payment(amount, card_token):
    # Cursor: Provides code structure, security patterns
    # Sophia: Handles business rules, customer interactions
```

```python
# ParagonRX Domain - Medical/Healthcare  
# Business Logic: Managed by Karen persona in production
# Database: paragon_medical_db
# Compliance: HIPAA compliance required
def validate_prescription(patient_id, medication):
    # Cursor: Provides medical coding patterns, data validation
    # Karen: Handles clinical decisions, patient interactions
```

```python
# Infrastructure Domain - System Coordination
# Business Logic: Managed by Cherry persona in production  
# Database: orchestra_coordination_db
# Purpose: Multi-domain system integration
def coordinate_deployment(services):
    # Cursor: Provides infrastructure patterns, deployment logic
    # Cherry: Handles business coordination, cross-domain decisions
```

### **Database Architecture Awareness**
Cursor knows these 3 distinct database setups for coding:

1. **Pay Ready Financial DB**
   - Payment processing tables
   - Financial compliance schemas
   - PCI DSS data handling patterns

2. **ParagonRX Medical DB** 
   - Patient data structures
   - Medical coding schemas (ICD-10)
   - HIPAA compliant data patterns

3. **Orchestra Coordination DB**
   - Cross-domain coordination tables
   - System integration schemas  
   - Multi-service orchestration patterns

## 🎯 **INTERFACE ARCHITECTURE**

### **Development Interface (Cursor AI)**
```
Developer → Cursor AI → Code Analysis → Domain Comments → IaC Deployment
                    ↓
                MCP Servers (Dev Tools)
                    ↓  
            Development Environment
```

### **Business Interface (Personas)**
```
Users → Android App → Personas → Business Logic → Database Operations
     → Admin Website →         → AI Orchestration → Customer Service
                              ↓
                      MCP Servers (Business Tools)
                              ↓
                      Production Environment  
```
