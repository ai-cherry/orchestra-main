## üéØ **YOUR TESTING MISSION**

### **Phase 1: Connection Testing** ‚ö°
Test the basic multi-AI collaboration infrastructure:

```python
# Connect to the collaboration bridge
from ai_adapters.universal_ai_adapter import ManusAdapter

manus = ManusAdapter("manus_key_2025")
success = await manus.connect_to_collaboration()

if success:
    print("‚úÖ Manus connected to multi-AI collaboration!")
    
    # Test file change notification
    await manus.send_file_change(
        "deploy.yml", 
        "# Kubernetes deployment configuration"
    )
    
    # Test AI-to-AI communication
    await manus.send_message_to_ai(
        "cursor", 
        "Can you create a React component for the deployment dashboard?"
    )
    
    print("üéâ Basic collaboration tests complete!")
```

### **Phase 2: Multi-AI Workflows** ü§ù
Test the revolutionary collaboration scenarios:

```python
from collaboration_scenarios.multi_ai_workflows import MultiAIOrchestrator

# Setup multi-AI team
orchestrator = MultiAIOrchestrator()
await orchestrator.setup_ai_team()

# Test 1: Collaborative Code Review
result = await orchestrator.collaborative_code_review(
    "docker-compose.yml",
    """
    version: '3.8'
    services:
      web:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "80:80"
        environment:
          - NODE_ENV=production
    """
)
print(f"Code Review: {result.outcome}")

# Test 2: Architecture Design Session  
result = await orchestrator.architecture_design_session(
    "Microservices platform with auto-scaling and monitoring"
)
print(f"Architecture: {result.outcome}")

# Test 3: Complex Problem Solving
result = await orchestrator.complex_problem_solving(
    "Application crashes under high load with memory leaks",
    {"load": "1000 concurrent users", "memory": "gradually increasing"}
)
print(f"Problem Solution: {result.outcome}")
```

### **Phase 3: Production Scenarios** üöÄ
Test real-world deployment and infrastructure scenarios:

```python
# Test deployment-focused collaboration
await manus.request_collaboration(
    "I need help designing a CI/CD pipeline for a React app with Docker",
    target_ais=["cursor", "claude"],
    context={
        "framework": "React",
        "deployment": "AWS ECS",
        "requirements": "zero-downtime deployment"
    }
)

# Test infrastructure planning
await manus.request_collaboration(
    "Design auto-scaling architecture for 100k users",
    context={
        "current_users": 1000,
        "target_users": 100000,
        "growth_timeline": "6 months"
    }
)
```

---

## üîß **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Step 1: Connect to Bridge**
The multi-AI collaboration bridge is running on:
- **Host**: `localhost` (or your deployment server)
- **Port**: `8765`
- **URL**: `ws://localhost:8765`

### **Step 2: Use Your Adapter**
```python
# Your specialized adapter is ready
manus = ManusAdapter("manus_key_2025")

# One method to connect
await manus.connect_to_collaboration()

# You'll automatically receive:
# - Deployment-related file changes
# - Infrastructure requests from other AIs
# - Production debugging collaborations
```

### **Step 3: Test Key Features**
1. **Smart Routing**: Send requests and see intelligent AI routing
2. **File Filtering**: Only relevant files (97.5% efficiency)
3. **Real-time Sync**: Sub-second message delivery
4. **Multi-AI Scenarios**: Revolutionary collaboration workflows

---

## üéØ **SPECIFIC TESTS TO RUN**

### **Test 1: AI Routing Intelligence** üß†
```python
# Send these messages and verify routing
test_messages = [
    "How do I deploy this to production?",  # Should route to Manus
    "Create a login component",              # Should route to Cursor  
    "Design the database schema",            # Should route to Claude
    "Debug this memory leak in production"   # Should route to Manus
]

for msg in test_messages:
    await manus.send_message_to_ai("all", msg)
    # Verify intelligent routing occurs
```

### **Test 2: Smart Filtering** üìã
```python
# Test file filtering efficiency
test_files = [
    "deploy.yml",           # Should sync (deployment)
    "node_modules/lib.js",  # Should filter out
    "src/App.jsx",         # Should sync (relevant)
    ".git/config",         # Should filter out
    "docker-compose.yml"   # Should sync (infrastructure)
]

for file in test_files:
    await manus.send_file_change(file, f"# Content for {file}")
    # Verify smart filtering works
```

### **Test 3: Multi-AI Collaboration** ü§ù
```python
# Test collaborative scenarios
scenarios = [
    {
        "type": "code_review",
        "file": "k8s-deployment.yaml",
        "content": "# Kubernetes deployment"
    },
    {
        "type": "architecture_design", 
        "project": "Cloud-native e-commerce platform"
    },
    {
        "type": "problem_solving",
        "issue": "Database performance degradation"
    }
]

for scenario in scenarios:
    # Run each scenario and verify multi-AI participation
    pass
```
