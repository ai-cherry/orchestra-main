# Orchestra AI Platform - Current Status Report
## Date: June 13, 2025

## Executive Summary
The Orchestra AI platform is experiencing multiple critical issues preventing successful deployment. The primary complaint about "static fake mock up" admin pages has been addressed by implementing a proper React-based admin system, but new technical challenges have emerged during the containerization process.

## Issues Discovered and Current Status

### 1. Frontend Build Failures ❌
**Status**: CRITICAL - Blocking deployment

#### Issues:
- Missing `AppContext` module causing TypeScript compilation failures
- Import resolution failures for `@/contexts/PersonaContext`
- Cannot resolve `@/lib/utils` module imports
- Vite CSS import order warnings

#### Error Messages:
```
src/main.tsx(5,29): error TS2307: Cannot find module './contexts/AppContext'
src/pages/ChatInterface.tsx: Failed to resolve import "@/contexts/PersonaContext"
src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx: Failed to resolve import "@/lib/utils"
```

#### Root Cause:
- TypeScript path mapping not properly configured
- Missing AppContext.tsx file in web/src/contexts/
- Incorrect @ alias resolution in Vite configuration

### 2. API Service Module Import Failures ❌
**Status**: CRITICAL - API cannot start

#### Issues:
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'database.connection'`
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'database.models'`
- Incorrect Python module structure in Docker container

#### Root Cause:
- Docker container WORKDIR is `/app` but code expects `/app/api` structure
- Python path configuration issues in containerized environment
- Module imports using relative paths incompatible with container structure

### 3. Docker Build Failures ❌
**Status**: CRITICAL - Cannot build containers

#### Issues:
- psutil package failing to build due to missing gcc
- python3-dev not installed in base image
- Build process exits with error code 1

#### Error Message:
```
psutil could not be installed from sources because gcc is not installed. Try running:
  sudo apt-get install gcc python3-dev
error: command 'gcc' failed: No such file or directory
```

#### Root Cause:
- Dockerfile missing system dependencies for building Python C extensions
- python:3.11-slim image too minimal for compilation requirements

### 4. Missing Python Dependencies ⚠️
**Status**: MODERATE - Causes runtime failures

#### Issues:
- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'magic'` (python-magic)
- `ValueError: the greenlet library is required` 
- SQLite UUID type incompatibility with SQLAlchemy

#### Root Cause:
- Missing system library dependencies (libmagic)
- Async SQLAlchemy requires greenlet for certain operations
- SQLite doesn't natively support UUID type

### 5. Service Port Conflicts ⚠️
**Status**: MODERATE - Prevents multiple services

#### Issues:
- Port 8000 already in use errors
- Frontend cycling through ports 3000-3003
- Multiple service instances attempting to start

#### Root Cause:
- Previous service instances not properly terminated
- No proper service orchestration before Docker implementation

## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Static Placeholders ✅
- Deleted all static HTML mockup files:
  - admin.html, real-admin.html, admin-functional.html
  - admin-improved.html, dashboard.html, test.html
- Replaced with proper React-based admin system

### 2. Implemented Docker Containerization ✅
- Created Docker Compose configuration
- Added Dockerfiles for API, MCP Server, and Frontend
- Configured auto-restart policies
- Set up proper service networking

### 3. Updated Documentation ✅
- Completely rewrote README.md for Docker deployment
- Created CURSOR_AI_CODING_GUIDELINES.md
- Removed references to manual startup scripts

### 4. Dependency Updates ✅
- Upgraded sentence-transformers from 2.2.2 to 4.1.0
- Updated requirements.txt files

## Current Architecture

```
orchestra-dev/
├── docker-compose.yml       # Orchestrates all services
├── Dockerfile.api          # API service container
├── Dockerfile.mcp          # MCP server container
├── Dockerfile.frontend     # Frontend nginx container
├── api/                    # FastAPI backend
├── mcp_servers/           # MCP memory server
├── web/                   # React frontend
└── shared/                # Shared types and utilities
```

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix Dockerfile.api and Dockerfile.mcp**:
   - Add gcc and python3-dev to apt-get install
   - Fix WORKDIR and Python path configuration

2. **Create Missing Frontend Files**:
   - Add AppContext.tsx to web/src/contexts/
   - Ensure all context providers exist

3. **Fix Python Module Imports**:
   - Update imports to use absolute paths
   - Configure proper PYTHONPATH in containers

4. **Fix TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Update tsconfig.json paths configuration
   - Ensure Vite resolves @ alias correctly

### Deployment Strategy:
1. Fix all build errors
2. Test containers locally with docker-compose
3. Deploy to production environment
4. Set up monitoring and logging

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Platform currently non-functional
- **Data Risk**: No data loss, but services unavailable
- **Timeline Risk**: Deployment delayed by technical issues
- **Mitigation**: Systematic fix of each issue category

## Conclusion
While the static placeholder removal was successful and the containerization architecture is sound, critical build and configuration issues must be resolved before the platform can be deployed. The shift from script-based to container-based deployment is the correct approach but requires immediate attention to the identified issues.
