# Comprehensive Action Plan: Codebase Stabilization, Optimization, and Deployment Readiness

This plan addresses all identified issues and opportunities for improvement in the coordination platform, ensuring a robust, performant, and maintainable system aligned with GCP deployment and single-developer priorities.

---

## 1. **Dependency Management & Environment Consistency**

### Steps
- **Audit and Remove Legacy Files:**
  - Delete all non-canonical requirements files (`requirements.txt`, `requirements-consolidated.txt`, `cherry_ai_api/requirements.txt`, `conductor/requirements.txt`, `agent/requirements.txt`, `packages/shared/requirements.txt`, `requirements-webscraping.txt`).
  - Retain only `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` for Python dependencies.
- **Update Documentation:**
  - Revise all onboarding, CI/CD, and deployment docs/scripts to reference only Poetry.

### Anticipated Challenges
- Legacy scripts or processes may reference old requirements files.

### Solutions
- Use `grep`/search to find and update all references.
- Add a pre-commit check to block accidental use of legacy files.

### Measurable Outcomes
- Only `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` remain for dependency management.
- All scripts and docs reference Poetry exclusively.

---

## 2. **Centralized Configuration & Logging**

### Steps
- **Enforce Usage:**
  - Refactor all modules to import and use `core/env_config.py` and `core/logging_config.py`.
- **Remove Redundancies:**
  - Eliminate any local or legacy config/logging code.

### Anticipated Challenges
- Hidden or indirect imports of legacy config/logging.

### Solutions
- Use static analysis tools (e.g., `grep`, `pylint`) to find all config/logging instantiations.

### Measurable Outcomes
- All modules use centralized config/logging.
- No legacy config/logging code remains.

---

## 3. **Linting, Formatting, and Type Compliance**

### Steps
- **Run and Fix:**
  - Execute `ruff`, `isort`, `black`, and `mypy` across the codebase.
  - Fix all lint/type issues: import order, unused imports, missing/incorrect type hints, Pydantic model subclassing.
- **Enforce in CI/CD:**
  - Ensure pre-commit and CI/CD pipelines block non-compliant code.

### Anticipated Challenges
- Complex type errors in dynamic or abstract modules.

### Solutions
- Incrementally add type hints, starting with public APIs and core modules.
- Use `# type: ignore` only as a last resort, with comments.

### Measurable Outcomes
- Zero lint/type errors in CI/CD.
- 100% of public functions and classes have type annotations.

---

## 4. **Code Structure, Modularity, and Duplication**

### Steps
- **Audit for Duplication:**
  - Review agent/memory modules for repeated logic.
- **Refactor:**
  - Move shared logic to utility modules.

### Anticipated Challenges
- Risk of breaking subtle agent-specific behaviors.

### Solutions
- Write/expand unit tests before refactoring.
- Refactor incrementally, validating after each step.

### Measurable Outcomes
- No significant code duplication in agent/memory modules.
- All shared logic is centralized.

---

## 5. **Performance and Resource Efficiency**

### Steps
- **Async Enforcement:**
  - Ensure all FastAPI endpoints and background tasks are async.
- **Profile and Optimize:**
  - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in agents/memory.
- **Resource Management:**
  - Audit for memory leaks and optimize long-running tasks.

### Anticipated Challenges
- Legacy sync code in async contexts.

### Solutions
- Use `asyncio` and FastAPI best practices.
- Replace blocking calls with async equivalents.

### Measurable Outcomes
- All endpoints/tasks are async.
- Profiling shows no major bottlenecks or leaks.

---

## 6. **Deployment Stability & GCP Alignment**

### Steps
- **Script Audit:**
  - Update all deployment scripts to use Poetry and centralized config.
- **Pulumi/IaC Review:**
  - Ensure infrastructure code is up-to-date and references only current workflows.
- **Secret Management:**
  - Use GCP Secret Manager for all sensitive data.

### Anticipated Challenges
- Outdated scripts or IaC referencing old files.

### Solutions
- Systematically test each deployment step in a staging environment.

### Measurable Outcomes
- Successful, repeatable deployments to GCP.
- No references to legacy files in deployment scripts.

---

## 7. **Security (Basic, Single-User)**

### Steps
- **Secret Audit:**
  - Remove all hardcoded secrets from codebase.
- **Input Validation:**
  - Add basic validation to all API endpoints.
- **CORS/Access:**
  - Restrict CORS and authentication to single-user/admin.

### Anticipated Challenges
- Overlooking secrets in rarely used modules.

### Solutions
- Use static analysis and manual review.

### Measurable Outcomes
- No hardcoded secrets.
- All endpoints have input validation.
- CORS is restricted.

---

## 8. **Documentation & Onboarding**

### Steps
- **Update All Docs:**
  - Revise onboarding, deployment, and architecture docs to reflect new workflows.
- **Remove Outdated Docs:**
  - Archive or delete any documentation referencing legacy files or processes.

### Anticipated Challenges
- Overlooked references in less-visible docs.

### Solutions
- Use search tools to find all references.

### Measurable Outcomes
- All documentation is current and accurate.
- No references to legacy workflows remain.

---

## 9. **Miscellaneous Cleanup**

### Steps
- **Remove Artifacts:**
  - Delete or archive process artifacts and temporary files (e.g., `CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md`, `UNFUCK_EVERYTHING.md`).

### Anticipated Challenges
- Accidentally removing files still needed for process tracking.

### Solutions
- Confirm with stakeholders before deletion.

### Measurable Outcomes
- Only relevant files are tracked in version control.
