- MCP Server: http://localhost:3000/health

### 3. **Production Deployment**
When ready for production:
```bash
# Create production stack
pulumi stack init prod

# Configure production secrets
pulumi config set --secret <key> <value>

# Deploy to production
pulumi up --yes
```

### 4. **Monitor & Maintain**
- Check Pulumi Cloud dashboard: https://app.pulumi.com/scoobyjava-org/orchestra-ai
- Monitor service health endpoints
- Review logs for any issues

## 🔒 Security Reminders

1. **API Key Rotation**: Consider rotating any API keys that were exposed during setup
2. **Access Control**: Limit Pulumi Cloud access to authorized team members
3. **Audit Trail**: Pulumi Cloud maintains full audit logs of all changes
4. **Backup**: State is backed up in Pulumi Cloud automatically

## 📝 Important Commands

```bash
# View current configuration (without secrets)
pulumi config

# View specific secret (be careful!)
pulumi config get <key> --show-secrets

# Add new secret
pulumi config set --secret <key> <value>

# Destroy infrastructure (careful!)
pulumi destroy

# Export stack state
pulumi stack export > stack-backup.json
```
