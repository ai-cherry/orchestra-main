## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **WebSocket scaling**: Use Redis adapter for Socket.io
- **File size limits**: Implement chunked uploads
- **Voice API costs**: Add usage quotas and caching
- **Search performance**: Use query optimization and indexing

### Operational Risks
- **Data privacy**: Implement encryption at rest and in transit
- **Service availability**: Use multi-region deployment
- **Cost management**: Implement usage monitoring and alerts
- **Vendor lock-in**: Use abstraction layers for third-party services

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Set up development environment**
   - Install Socket.io server dependencies
   - Configure development database
   - Set up file storage (local/S3)
   - Configure API keys for voice services

2. **Create API specifications**
   - Document WebSocket events
   - Define REST API endpoints
   - Create OpenAPI specification
   - Define data models

3. **Implement core backend**
   - Basic WebSocket server
   - File upload endpoint
   - Search API endpoint
   - Voice transcription endpoint

4. **Integration testing**
   - End-to-end file upload flow
   - Real-time search updates
   - Voice recording and transcription
   - WebSocket reconnection scenarios
