# JWK File Information for GitHub Actions OIDC Provider

## About the JWK File Field

The JWK (JSON Web Key) file field in the Google Cloud console is **optional** for GitHub Actions. The warning message is informational, not an error:

> Warning: If you don't specify a JWK file, the JWK will be fetched from issuer instead.

## Recommendation

**Leave this field empty.**

For GitHub Actions, it's standard practice to let Google Cloud automatically fetch the JWK from GitHub's OIDC issuer URL (https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com). GitHub maintains these keys and rotates them periodically, so letting Google Cloud fetch them directly ensures you're always using the current keys.

## Why This Is Safe

1. GitHub publishes its JWK set at a well-known endpoint: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com/.well-known/jwks`
2. Google Cloud will automatically fetch and cache these keys
3. This is the recommended approach in the GitHub Actions documentation

## If You're Still Getting an Error

If you're still getting an error after leaving the JWK field empty, please check:

1. The Issuer URL is exactly: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
2. You have internet connectivity from the Google Cloud console to GitHub
3. There are no firewall rules blocking access to GitHub's OIDC endpoints

You can proceed with the setup by leaving the JWK field empty and clicking "Continue" to move to the next step.
