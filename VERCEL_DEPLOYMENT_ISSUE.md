# Vercel Deployment Issue Analysis - June 14, 2025

## 🚨 Problem: Vercel Still Showing 404

Despite pushing all fixes to GitHub, Vercel is still showing 404 NOT_FOUND errors. This suggests the deployment is not being triggered or is failing.

## 🔍 Possible Causes

### 1. Vercel Auto-Deploy Not Triggered
- GitHub push may not have triggered Vercel deployment
- Vercel webhook might be misconfigured
- Build may be failing silently

### 2. Build Configuration Issues
- vercel.json changes may not be taking effect
- Build command might be failing on Vercel's servers
- Dependencies installation failing in Vercel environment

### 3. Vercel Project Configuration
- Project may be pointing to wrong branch
- Build settings may be overridden in Vercel dashboard
- Environment variables may be missing

## 🛠️ Immediate Actions Needed

### Option 1: Manual Vercel Deployment
Use Vercel CLI to force deployment:
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Check Vercel Dashboard
- Login to Vercel dashboard
- Check deployment logs
- Verify build configuration
- Trigger manual deployment

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment
- Deploy to Netlify as backup
- Use GitHub Pages for static hosting
- Deploy to Railway/Render
