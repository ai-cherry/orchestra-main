# AI Assistant Boundaries & Usage Guidelines

## When to Use Cursor vs 

### Use Cursor For:
- **Quick edits and refactoring** (Cmd+K inline edits)
- **Simple code generation** from existing patterns
- **File-level operations** (create, modify single files)
- **IDE-integrated development** (while actively coding)
- **Fast iterations** with immediate feedback

### Use  For:
- **Complex multi-step workflows** requiring specialized modes

### Never Do These:
- **Don't duplicate instructions** between Cursor rules and  modes
- **Don't create temporary files** without explicit lifecycle management
- **Don't override project priorities** (performance > security for this project)
- **Don't use both tools simultaneously** for the same task

## Token Optimization Rules
- **Cursor rules**: Keep concise, focus on immediate coding standards
- ** modes**: Handle complex, multi-step workflows with context retention
- **Shared standards**: Defined once in this file, referenced by both

## Emergency Override
