# AI Memory System

This directory contains memory files used by AI assistants working on this project.

## Purpose

These files establish the project's performance-first philosophy in the AI memory system,
ensuring all AI tools prioritize performance, optimization, and stability over extensive
security measures.

## Important Files

- `performance_priorities.json`: Core priorities configuration
- `memory_index.json`: Index of memory files for AI assistants
- Symbolic links to relevant documentation

## Maintenance

This directory is maintained by:
- `update_ai_memory_priorities.py` script
- The `apply_performance_priorities.sh` script with the --update-all flag

Do not modify these files directly unless you specifically want to change the 
project priorities.
