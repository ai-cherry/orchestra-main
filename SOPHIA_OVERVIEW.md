# SOPHIA: Executive-Level Business Intelligence System for PayReady

## Overview
SOPHIA is a custom-built, AI-powered executive business intelligence system tailored for PayReady, a technology platform serving the apartment industry. The primary goal of SOPHIA is to centralize, enhance, and operationalize business intelligence through an advanced interface that supports executive decision-making, strategic alignment, employee evaluation, financial clarity, and dynamic organizational workflows.

## Data Ingestion & Sources
All data is continuously ingested into Snowflake from the following platforms:
- **Gong.io** – Call intelligence and conversation insights
- **Salesforce** – CRM and sales pipeline data
- **HubSpot** – Marketing and customer engagement data
- **Slack** – Team communications and behavior patterns
- **Looker** – Custom reporting downloads for structured insights
- **NetSuite** – Financials, billing, and ERP
- **Lattice** – Performance reviews, goal tracking, and employee behavior

Data enhancement also occurs via:
- **UserGems** – Prospect intelligence and contact enrichment
- **Apollo.io** – Lead data and enrichment
- Other external data enhancement tools as needed

## LLM & AI Stack Strategy
- **Portkey** serves as the central orchestrator for LLM routing
- **OpenRouter** is the default LLM backend
- Direct API access to other LLMs for redundancy and flexibility

### Embeddings & Vector Storage
- **Pinecone** – Vector DB for memory/context retrieval
- **Redis** – Fast caching and lightweight memory store

### Compute & Deployment
- **Lambda Labs** – Scalable GPU infrastructure for AI workloads

## Interface Design
A custom web interface provides:
- A dynamic chat/search interface as the primary mode of interaction
- Basic administrative panels for executive dashboards and control
- Deeply contextualized and nuanced responses tailored to executives

## AI Agents & Workflows
The system includes AI-powered agents and workflows such as:
- **Sales Coach Agent** – Real-time guidance based on Gong, CRM, and performance data
- **Client Health Agent** – Monitors churn risk, engagement, and health scores

## Instructions for Coding Agent
- Re-evaluate all infrastructure components and ensure alignment with this architecture
- Refactor documentation, codebase, and workflows accordingly
- Validate APIs, data syncs, and LLM pipelines are robust and secure
- Optimize interface to prioritize high-performance chat search UX
- Ensure modularity to support future expansion of agents and features
