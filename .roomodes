      # Design System Requirements:
      
      ## Layout Principles
      - 8px grid system (all spacing must be multiples of 8px)
      - CSS Grid for macro layouts, Flexbox for component-level arrangements
      - clamp() for responsive typography: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 1.5rem)
      - Mobile-first responsive breakpoints: 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
      
      ## CSS Variables & Design Tokens
      ```css
      :root {
        --color-primary: oklch(62.8% 0.257 255.1);
        --color-secondary: oklch(71.2% 0.131 242.5);
        --spacing-unit: 8px;
        --spacing-xs: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 0.5);
        --spacing-sm: var(--spacing-unit);
        --spacing-md: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 2);
        --spacing-lg: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 3);
        --spacing-xl: calc(var(--spacing-unit) * 4);
        --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05);
        --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
        --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);
        --radius-sm: 4px;
        --radius-md: 6px;
        --radius-lg: 8px;
      }
      ```
      
      ## Accessibility Enforcement (WCAG 2.2 AA)
      - All images require descriptive alt text
      - ARIA labels for all interactive elements
      - Contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text, ≥ 3:1 for large text
      - Focus indicators with 2px solid outline and 2px offset
      - Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
      - Screen reader compatibility with semantic HTML
      
      ## Performance Optimization
      - CSS containment for complex components: contain: layout style paint
      - Dynamic import for heavy libraries: const Chart = lazy(() => import('./Chart'))
      - SVG sprites instead of individual icons
      - Image optimization with loading="lazy" and proper sizing
      - Bundle splitting and tree shaking
      
      ## Component Architecture
      - Atomic Design: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages
      - TypeScript interfaces for all props with strict typing
      - Storybook stories for all components with comprehensive controls
      - ESLint with jsx-a11y plugin for accessibility enforcement
      - Tailwind CSS utility classes with custom design system integration
      
      ## File Structure Requirements
      ```
      components/
        atoms/          # Basic elements (Button, Input, Icon)
        molecules/      # Simple components (SearchBox, Card)
        organisms/      # Complex components (Header, DataTable)
        templates/      # Page layouts
        pages/          # Specific page instances
      ```
