# Early Deployment Strategy: Infrastructure Before Content

This document explains how to deploy the Figma webhook integration infrastructure before your website or Figma designs are finalized.

## Benefits of Early Infrastructure Deployment

- **Pipeline readiness**: Have your automation ready the moment your design team starts using Figma
- **Reduced launch friction**: Eliminate deployment delays when your website is ready to go live
- **Infrastructure testing**: Verify your connection mechanisms without risking real design or website content
- **Parallel development**: Allow infrastructure, design, and website development to proceed simultaneously

## Components You Can Deploy Now

Even without an active website or populated Figma files, you can deploy:

### 1. Google Cloud Platform Infrastructure

```bash
# Create and configure GCP project
gcloud projects create PROJECT_ID --name="Figma Integration"
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

# Enable all required APIs
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com \
    secretmanager.googleapis.com \
    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
    containerregistry.googleapis.com \
    aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

### 2. Webhook Handler Service

```bash
# Deploy the webhook handler to Cloud Run
./scripts/deploy_webhook_to_cloud_run.sh --project=YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID
```

This creates a running service that's ready to receive events, even if no events are being sent yet.

### 3. GitHub Repository Configuration

- Set up GitHub Actions workflows
- Configure repository secrets
- Implement the `figma-triggered-deploy.yml` workflow

### 4. Monitoring & Logging Infrastructure  

```bash
# Set up logging bucket
gcloud logging buckets create figma-webhook-logs \
  --location=global \
  --description="Figma webhook integration logs"

# Create monitoring dashboard
gcloud monitoring dashboards create \
  --config-from-file=dashboard-config.json
```

## What to Defer Until Later

Some components should wait until you have active Figma files or a website project:

- **Figma webhook registration**: You'll need an actual Figma team ID and file to register against
- **Component extraction logic**: Fine-tune after you have real designs to test with
- **UI component generation**: Needs to match your actual website technology stack

## How to Adapt When Content is Ready

### When Figma is Ready:

1. Register your webhook with your new Figma team:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_figma_webhook.sh
   ```

2. Modify the webhook to point to your already-deployed Cloud Run service
   ```bash
   curl -X PATCH \
     -H "X-Figma-Token: $FIGMA_PAT" \
     "https://api.figma.com/v2/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID" \
     -d "{\"endpoint\": \"https://your-deployed-service.run.app/figma-webhook\"}"
   ```

### When Website Project is Ready:

1. Update the GitHub workflow to target your website repository
2. Configure deployment targets based on your website's hosting
3. Customize the component generation logic for your tech stack

## Placeholder Figma Testing

While waiting for real Figma designs, you can use a test Figma file:

1. Create a free Figma account
2. Create a simple test file with basic components
3. Use it to test your webhook infrastructure
4. Replace with your real team/file when ready

## Estimated Timeline

| Phase | Time Required | Dependencies |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| GCP Infrastructure | 1-2 hours | GCP account |
| Webhook Handler | 1 hour | GCP infrastructure |
| GitHub Configuration | 1 hour | GitHub repository |
| Monitoring Setup | 1-2 hours | GCP infrastructure |
| **Total Early Deployment** | **4-6 hours** | |
| | | |
| Figma Integration | 1-2 hours | Figma team/files |
| Website Integration | 2-4 hours | Website repository |
| End-to-End Testing | 2-4 hours | All components |

## Conclusion

By implementing this "infrastructure-first" approach, you can:

1. Have your automation pipeline ready for day one of design work
2. Test and refine your infrastructure before risking production content
3. Enable parallel development workflows between design, infrastructure, and website teams
4. Accelerate your final launch timeline by eliminating infrastructure setup delays

This strategy aligns with modern DevOps principles of pipeline-as-code and infrastructure-as-code, allowing you to build, test, and deploy your automation framework independently of the content that will eventually flow through it.
