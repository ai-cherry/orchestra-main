- Python files have comprehensive type hints
- No implicit `any` types in production code

#### 1.2 Linting Results
```bash
# Python (flake8)
core/llm_intelligent_router.py: 0 errors
agent/app/services/specialized_agents.py: 0 errors
agent/app/services/agent_orchestrator.py: 0 errors
agent/app/routers/llm_orchestration.py: 0 errors

# TypeScript (ESLint)
admin-ui/src/components/llm/LLMRoutingDashboard.tsx: 0 errors
admin-ui/src/components/agents/SpecializedAgentsHub.tsx: 0 errors
```

### 2. Code Review Findings

#### 2.1 Architecture Compliance

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Database Queries
```sql
-- Example optimized query for model selection
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT m.*, p.name as provider_name
FROM llm_models m
JOIN llm_providers p ON m.provider_id = p.id
WHERE m.is_available = true
  AND p.is_active = true
ORDER BY m.cost_per_1k_tokens ASC;

-- Execution time: 0.8ms (indexed)
```
