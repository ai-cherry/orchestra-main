# LLM Management Architecture with Intelligent Routing

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive LLM management architecture integrating Portkey, OpenRouter, and direct LLM APIs with intelligent routing mechanisms, along with three specialized AI research agents.

## Architecture Components

### 1. LLM Gateway Layer

#### 1.1 Intelligent Router
- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Automatically selects optimal LLMs based on query type
- **Cost Optimization**: Routes to most cost-effective models while maintaining quality
- **Latency-Based Failover**: Automatic failover to backup models on high latency
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple providers

#### 1.2 Query Classification
- **Creative Search**: High-temperature models (GPT-4, Claude-3-Opus)
- **Deep Search**: Analytical reasoning chains (GPT-4-Turbo, Claude-3-Sonnet)
- **Super Deep Search**: Multi-step verification (GPT-4 with CoT, Mixtral-8x7B)
- **Media Generation**: Specialized models (DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion XL)

### 2. Administrative Dashboard

#### 2.1 Model Management
- Real-time model availability monitoring
- Cost tracking and optimization
- Performance metrics visualization
- A/B testing framework

#### 2.2 Routing Rules Engine
- Visual rule builder for routing logic
- Priority-based model selection
- Custom routing for specific use cases
- Emergency override controls

### 3. Specialized AI Research Agents

#### 3.1 Personal Agent
- **User Preference Learning**: Adaptive ML model for preference tracking
- **Contextual Memory**: Vector database for long-term memory
- **Search Refinement**: Iterative improvement based on feedback
- **Personalization Engine**: Custom ranking algorithms

#### 3.2 Pay Ready Agent (Apartment Rental)
- **Market Analysis**: Real-time pricing data integration
- **Neighborhood Scoring**: Demographics and amenity analysis
- **Smart Home Features**: IoT and tech amenity tracking
- **Comparative Analysis**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm

#### 3.3 Paragon Medical Research Agent
- **Clinical Trial Discovery**: ClinicalTrials.gov API integration
- **PubMed Integration**: Literature search and analysis
- **Eligibility Parsing**: NLP for criteria extraction
- **Alert System**: Real-time notifications for matching trials
