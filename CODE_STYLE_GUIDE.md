# Code Style and Consistency Guide

This document outlines the code style and consistency standards that have been implemented to address the minor areas for improvement identified in the code review.

## 1. Import Standards

We've standardized import ordering and grouping throughout the codebase with the following configuration in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
line_length = 100
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = true
force_grid_wrap = 0
use_parentheses = true
ensure_newline_before_comments = true
skip_gitignore = true
sections = ["FUTURE", "STDLIB", "THIRDPARTY", "FIRSTPARTY", "LOCALFOLDER"]
```

### Import Order Guidelines

- **Future** imports: `from __future__ import annotations`
- **Standard Library** imports: `import os, sys, datetime, etc.`
- **Third-Party** imports: `import requests, numpy, etc.`
- **First-Party** imports: Imports from other modules within this project
- **Local** imports: Imports from the same directory

### Example

```python
# Future imports
from __future__ import annotations

# Standard library imports
import json
import logging
import os
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

# Third-party library imports
import requests
import yaml
from google.cloud import storage

# First-party imports (from elsewhere in the project)
from ai_orchestra.core.config import settings
from ai_orchestra.utils.logging import log_event

# Local imports (from the same directory)
from .error_handler import WIFError, ErrorSeverity
from .models import Configuration
```

## 2. Error Handling Patterns

We've created a standardized error handling framework in `utils/error_handling.py` to ensure consistent error handling across the codebase. This includes:

- A base `BaseError` class with standardized properties and methods
- Decorators for function error handling (`handle_exception`)
- Context managers for block-level error handling (`error_context`)
- Utility functions for safe execution (`safe_execute`)

### Example Usage

```python
# Decorator-based error handling
@handle_exception(target_error=ConfigError)
def load_config(config_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Function implementation
    pass

# Context manager-based error handling
with error_context(DataProcessingError, "Error processing data"):
    # Code block that might raise exceptions
    pass

# Safe execution
result = safe_execute(
    risky_function,
    arg1, arg2,
    default=default_value,
    log_errors=True
)
```

See the complete example in `examples/error_handling_example.py`.

## 3. Code Formatting

We've standardized code formatting with Black and set a consistent line length of 100 characters:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ["py38", "py39", "py310"]
include = '\.pyi?$'
```

### Guidelines for Manual Formatting

- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Indentation: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- Blank lines: 2 between top-level functions/classes, 1 between methods
- Docstrings: Use Google-style docstrings

## 4. Pre-commit Hooks

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file has been updated to enforce these standards automatically:

- **Black**: For code formatting
- **isort**: For import sorting
- **flake8**: For linting
- **mypy**: For type checking

### Using Pre-commit

To use the pre-commit hooks:

1. Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`
2. Install the hooks: `pre-commit install`
3. (Optional) Run against all files: `pre-commit run --all-files`

Pre-commit will automatically run on each commit to ensure code consistency.

## 5. Implementation Strategy

For existing files:

1. Apply Black formatting: `black .`
2. Sort imports: `isort .`
3. Fix linting issues: `flake8`

For new files:

1. Follow the import ordering guidelines
2. Use the standardized error handling framework
3. Let the pre-commit hooks maintain formatting consistency

## Conclusion

By adhering to these standards, we ensure:

1. Consistent import organization across the codebase
2. Standardized, robust error handling
3. Uniform code formatting and style

These improvements lead to more maintainable, readable, and robust code.
