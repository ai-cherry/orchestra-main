# AI Orchestra Deployment Infrastructure Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to consolidate and improve the AI Orchestra deployment infrastructure for Google Cloud Run.

## Changes Made

### New Files Created

1. **deploy.sh** - New consolidated deployment script that provides:
   - Comprehensive command-line parameters
   - Clear, colorized output with progress indicators
   - Environment-aware configuration
   - Proper error handling
   - Artifact Registry integration
   - Deployment verification

2. **CLOUD_RUN_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Detailed documentation for the new deployment script
   - Parameters reference
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting guidance

3. **.github/workflows/deploy-cloud-run.yml** - New GitHub Actions workflow using:
   - Workload Identity Federation for secure GCP authentication
   - Standardized CI/CD process for both staging and production
   - Test verification before deployment

### Files Updated

1. **SIMPLE_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Updated to reference new deployment approach
2. **docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Updated to document new deployment script

### Files Removed (Redundant)

1. **deploy_to_cloud_run.sh** - Replaced by deploy.sh
2. **deploy_to_cloud_run_hardcoded.sh** - Replaced by deploy.sh
3. **simple_deploy.sh** - Replaced by deploy.sh
4. **.github/workflows/deploy-orchestra-api.yml** - Replaced by deploy-cloud-run.yml
5. **.github/workflows/simple-deploy.yml** - Replaced by deploy-cloud-run.yml
6. **.github/workflows/deploy-to-gcp.yml** - Replaced by deploy-cloud-run.yml

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistency**: Standardized on one clear deployment approach across environments
2. **Better Configuration**: Improved parameter handling and environment configuration
3. **Maintainability**: Well-structured, documented code with clear sections and functions
4. **Modern Infrastructure**: Using Artifact Registry instead of legacy GCR
5. **Reliability**: Built-in dependency checking and deployment verification
6. **User Experience**: Improved output with colorized, timestamp-based logging

## Usage Instructions

### Local Deployment

```bash
# Basic usage with defaults
./deploy.sh

# Custom deployment
./deploy.sh --project my-project-id --region us-east1 --env production
```

### CI/CD

The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered by:
- Pushes to the main branch (auto-deploys to staging)
- Manual workflow dispatch with environment selection (staging/production)
