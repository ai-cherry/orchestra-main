# Infrastructure as Code - Orchestra AI Deployment

## Overview
This deployment uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to ensure:
- **Repeatability**: All deployments can be recreated exactly
- **Version Control**: All infrastructure changes are tracked in Git
- **Idempotency**: Running the same commands multiple times produces the same result
- **Documentation**: Infrastructure is self-documenting through code

## IaC Components

### 1. Docker Infrastructure (`docker-compose.production.yml`)
- Defines all 7 services with exact versions
- Network configuration (cherry_ai_production)
- Volume persistence definitions
- Health check configurations
- Resource limits and constraints

### 2. Deployment Scripts
- `deploy_clean_slate.sh` - Automated clean deployment
- `monitor_deployment.py` - Real-time monitoring
- `check_ports.sh` - Port availability verification
- `port_manager.py` - Dynamic port allocation

### 3. Notion Integration (`notion_deployment_update_iac.py`)
- Automated status updates to Notion databases
- Idempotent updates (hash-based change detection)
- Structured data updates across multiple databases
- Performance metrics and deployment logs

### 4. Configuration Management
- Environment variables for secrets
- Dockerfile configurations for each service
- Nginx configuration templates
- API configuration with proper DATABASE_URL format

## IaC Benefits Realized

### Consistency
- Same deployment process every time
- No manual configuration drift
- Predictable outcomes

### Automation
- One-command deployment: `./deploy_clean_slate.sh`
- Automatic health monitoring and recovery
- Automated Notion updates

### Versioning
- All infrastructure changes in Git
- Rollback capability
- Change history and audit trail

### Documentation
- Infrastructure documented as code
- Self-explanatory configurations
- Inline comments for complex sections

## Usage

### Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
./deploy_clean_slate.sh
```

### Monitor Deployment
```bash
python3 monitor_deployment.py
```

### Update Notion
```bash
export NOTION_API_KEY='your-key-here'
python3 notion_deployment_update_iac.py
```

### Check System Health
```bash
docker ps
curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/health
```

## Future IaC Enhancements
1. Terraform/Pulumi for cloud infrastructure
2. Ansible playbooks for configuration management
3. GitOps with ArgoCD for continuous deployment
4. Kubernetes manifests for container orchestration
5. Automated testing pipelines

## Conclusion
The Orchestra AI deployment fully embraces Infrastructure as Code principles, resulting in a robust, maintainable, and scalable system that can be deployed consistently across any environment.
