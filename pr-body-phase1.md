## Phase 1: Repository Hygiene & Foundations

### Summary
Implements comprehensive repository cleanup, dependency consolidation, and development tooling setup as part of the modernization initiative.

### Changes
- ✅ **Python**: Migrated to Poetry with Black/Ruff/isort configuration
- ✅ **Node.js**: Set up pnpm workspace with auto-peer-deps
- ✅ **Docker**: Traefik-based development stack (90xx ports)
- ✅ **CI/CD**: Path-filtered workflows with matrix testing
- ✅ **Quality**: Pre-commit hooks for all languages
- ✅ **Developer Experience**: Makefile with common commands

### Key Files Added
- `pyproject.toml` - Enhanced Poetry configuration with tooling
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - pnpm monorepo setup
- `dev-compose.yml` - Docker development environment
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Comprehensive pre-commit hooks
- `.github/workflows/ci-phase1.yml` - New CI pipeline
- `Makefile.phase1` - Developer commands
- `docs/phase-1-implementation.md` - Full documentation
- `docs/phase-1-merge-plan.md` - Merge strategy

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Local Python tests pass
- [x] Docker Compose configuration validated
- [x] Pre-commit hooks tested
- [ ] CI workflow will run on this PR
- [ ] Waiting for review approval

### Migration Notes
**⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE**: After merge, all developers need to:

1. **Install Poetry** (Python package manager):
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. **Install pnpm** (Node.js package manager):
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

3. **Run setup**:
   ```bash
   make install
   make pre-commit
   ```

### Benefits
- 🚀 **Eliminates port conflicts** with Traefik routing
- 📦 **Fixes NPM peer dependency issues** with pnpm auto-install
- ✅ **Enforces code quality** with pre-commit hooks
- 🔄 **Speeds up CI** with path-based filtering
- 📚 **Simplifies onboarding** to < 30 minutes
