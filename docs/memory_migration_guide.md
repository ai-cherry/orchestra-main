# Memory Management Migration Guide

This guide provides instructions for migrating from the V1 memory management implementation to the new V2 implementation.

## Overview

The AI Orchestra project has consolidated its memory management implementations to improve performance, stability, and maintainability. The new V2 implementation provides:

- Better performance through connection pooling and optimized operations
- Enhanced stability with improved error handling and circuit breaker patterns
- Better observability with detailed health checks and metrics
- Support for GCP Vector Search integration (coming soon)

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Update Imports

Replace imports from the legacy implementation with imports from the V2 implementation:

```python
# Before
from packages.shared.src.storage.firestore.firestore_memory import FirestoreMemoryManager
from packages.shared.src.memory.concrete_memory_manager import FirestoreV1MemoryManager

# After
from packages.shared.src.storage.firestore.v2 import FirestoreMemoryManagerV2
```

### Step 2: Update Initialization

Update the initialization code to use the V2 implementation:

```python
# Before
firestore_memory = FirestoreMemoryManager(
    project_id=project_id,
    credentials_path=credentials_path,
)
memory_manager = FirestoreV1MemoryManager(
    firestore_memory=firestore_memory,
    redis_host=redis_host,
    redis_port=redis_port,
)

# After
memory_manager = FirestoreMemoryManagerV2(
    project_id=project_id,
    credentials_path=credentials_path,
    connection_pool_size=10,  # Optional, default is 10
    batch_size=100,  # Optional, default is 400
)
```

Alternatively, you can use the factory class with the V2 implementation:

```python
from packages.shared.src.memory.memory_manager import MemoryManager

memory_manager = MemoryManager(
    memory_backend_type="firestore_v2",  # Explicitly specify V2
    project_id=project_id,
    credentials_path=credentials_path,
    connection_pool_size=10,  # Optional, default is 10
    batch_size=100,  # Optional, default is 400
)
```

### Step 3: Update Error Handling

The V2 implementation uses standardized exceptions from `packages.shared.src.storage.exceptions`. Update your error handling code to catch these exceptions:

```python
from packages.shared.src.storage.exceptions import (
    StorageError, ConnectionError, ValidationError, 
    OperationError, NotFoundError, DuplicateError
)

try:
    result = await memory_manager.get_memory_item(item_id)
except NotFoundError:
    # Handle not found case
except ConnectionError:
    # Handle connection error
except StorageError as e:
    # Handle other storage errors
```

### Step 4: Update Health Checks

The V2 implementation provides more detailed health check information. Update your health check handling code to use the new fields:

```python
health = await memory_manager.health_check()

# Check overall status
if health["status"] == "healthy":
    logger.info("Memory system is healthy")
elif health["status"] == "degraded":
    logger.warning(f"Memory system is degraded: {health['details'].get('reason')}")
else:
    logger.error(f"Memory system is unhealthy: {health['details']}")

# Check Firestore status
if health["firestore"]:
    logger.info(f"Firestore is healthy, latency: {health['details'].get('firestore_latency_ms')} ms")
else:
    logger.error(f"Firestore is unhealthy: {health['details'].get('firestore_error')}")
```

## API Differences

The V2 implementation is mostly compatible with the V1 implementation, but there are some differences:

### New Features in V2

- Connection pooling for better performance
- Configurable batch sizes
- Enhanced health checks with detailed metrics
- Standardized exception hierarchy
- Support for GCP Vector Search integration (coming soon)

### Breaking Changes

- The `get_memory_item` method now raises `NotFoundError` instead of returning `None` when an item is not found
- The `health_check` method returns a more detailed structure with additional fields
- The `FirestoreMemoryManagerV2` constructor takes different parameters than `FirestoreV1MemoryManager`

## Performance Comparison

The V2 implementation provides significant performance improvements over the V1 implementation:

- **Add Operations**: Up to 2x faster
- **Get Operations**: Up to 3x faster
- **Semantic Search**: Up to 5x faster with large datasets
- **Conversation History**: Up to 2x faster

You can run the benchmark tests to compare the performance on your specific workload:

```bash
python -m tests.benchmarks.memory_benchmark --item-count 100
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you encounter connection issues with the V2 implementation, check:

1. Firestore credentials and permissions
2. Network connectivity to Firestore
3. Connection pool size (try increasing if you have high concurrency)

### Performance Issues

If you encounter performance issues with the V2 implementation, check:

1. Batch size configuration (try adjusting based on your workload)
2. Connection pool size (try increasing if you have high concurrency)
3. Redis configuration (if using Redis for caching)

### Migration Issues

If you encounter issues during migration, please:

1. Check the API differences section above
2. Update your error handling code to catch the new exception types
3. Update your health check handling code to use the new fields
