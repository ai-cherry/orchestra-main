# Advanced Features Roadmap for Orchestra AI

This document outlines when and why to consider the currently "Not Implemented" features.

## 🎯 Decision Framework

### Current Project State
- **Team Size**: Small, experienced team
- **Deployment**: Single production environment on Vultr
- **Architecture**: Monolithic FastAPI + React admin
- **Scale**: Growing but manageable
- **Stability**: High priority (performance > complexity)

## 📋 Feature Analysis

### 1. Poetry/Docker Migration
**Current Status**: ❌ Explicitly avoided
**Trigger Points**: Consider when you hit these thresholds

#### Poetry Migration Triggers
```bash
# Trigger 1: Dependency Hell (frequency > monthly)
pip install new-package
# ERROR: Incompatible dependency versions

# Trigger 2: Team Growth (> 5 developers)
# Onboarding time > 2 hours due to environment setup

# Trigger 3: Multiple Python Services
# When you split into microservices

# Trigger 4: Complex Dependencies
# When you need specific versions for different components
```

**Migration Strategy** (if triggered):
```python
# Phase 1: Parallel setup (2 weeks)
pyproject.toml  # Poetry config alongside requirements.txt
poetry install  # Verify equivalent environment

# Phase 2: CI/CD update (1 week)  
poetry export -f requirements.txt  # Generate requirements.txt
# Keep both systems temporarily

# Phase 3: Full migration (1 week)
# Remove requirements.txt, update all scripts
```

**ROI Calculation**:
- **Cost**: 4 weeks team time, potential deployment issues
- **Benefit**: Faster onboarding, better dependency management
- **Break-even**: When environment issues > 1 day/month

#### Docker Migration Triggers
```yaml
# Trigger 1: Multi-environment complexity
production:
  python: 3.10.12
  os: Ubuntu 22.04
staging:
  python: 3.10.8  # ← Version drift causing bugs
  os: Ubuntu 20.04

# Trigger 2: Scaling requirements
# When you need > 1 server instance

# Trigger 3: Complex deployment dependencies
# System packages, specific OS requirements

# Trigger 4: Development environment inconsistency
# "Works on my machine" issues > weekly
```

### 2. Complex Pydantic Features
**Current Status**: 🟡 Selectively implemented
**When to Expand**:

#### Use Case Matrix
| Feature | Use Case | Trigger | Implementation Priority |
|---------|----------|---------|------------------------|
| **Computed Fields** ✅ | UI performance | DB queries > 100ms | **Implemented** |
| **Model Validators** ✅ | Business rules | Complex validation logic | **Implemented** |
| **Field Serializers** ✅ | API consistency | Frontend formatting needs | **Implemented** |
| **Root Validators** | Cross-field logic | Multi-step validation | **Next** |
| **Custom Types** | Domain modeling | Repeated validation patterns | **Future** |
| **Discriminated Unions** | Polymorphism | Multiple model types | **Future** |

#### Implementation Examples

**Next: Root Validators for Workflow Logic**
```python
# When you need complex workflow validation
class WorkflowDefinition(BaseModel):
    steps: List[WorkflowStep]
    dependencies: Dict[str, List[str]]
    
    @root_validator
    def validate_dependency_graph(cls, values):
        steps = values.get('steps', [])
        deps = values.get('dependencies', {})
        
        # Detect circular dependencies
        if has_circular_dependency(steps, deps):
            raise ValueError("Circular dependency detected")
        return values
```

**Future: Custom Types for Domain Logic**
```python
# When you have repeated validation patterns
class PersonaSlug(str):
    """Custom type for persona slugs across the system."""
    
    @classmethod
    def __modify_schema__(cls, field_schema):
        field_schema.update(
            pattern=r'^[a-z0-9-]+$',
            examples=['ai-assistant', 'code-reviewer']
        )
```

### 3. TypeScript Ultra-Strict Mode
**Current Status**: 🟢 Partially enhanced
**Gradual Adoption Plan**:

#### Phase 1: Immediate (✅ Implemented)
```json
{
  "noImplicitReturns": true,        // All paths return values
  "allowUnreachableCode": false,    // No dead code
  "allowUnusedLabels": false        // Clean switch statements
}
```

#### Phase 2: When codebase is stable (1-2 months)
```json
{
  "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,  // Safer object access
  "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true            // Array bounds checking
}
```

#### Phase 3: When team is comfortable (3-6 months)
```json
{
  "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true  // Stricter optional types
}
```

**Migration Impact**:
```typescript
// Phase 2 will require changes like:
// Before
const user = users[id];  // ❌ Error

// After  
const user = users[id] ?? defaultUser;  // ✅ Safe
```

### 4. Alternative Package Managers
**Current Status**: ✅ pnpm (optimal choice)
**No Migration Needed**: pnpm > npm for your use case

## 🚦 Decision Triggers

### Red Light 🔴 (Don't Implement)
- Team size < 5 people
- Single deployment environment  
- Current approach working well
- No performance/reliability issues

### Yellow Light 🟡 (Monitor & Prepare)
- Growing team (approaching 5+ people)
- Multiple environments needed
- Dependency management pain points
- Onboarding time increasing

### Green Light 🟢 (Implement)
- Clear pain points with current approach
- Team bandwidth for migration
- Business justification (time/cost savings)
- Stakeholder buy-in for potential short-term disruption

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. ✅ Enhanced TypeScript strictness (already implemented)
2. ✅ Advanced Pydantic features (already implemented)
3. Monitor team growth and pain points

### 3-Month Horizon
1. Evaluate TypeScript Phase 2 strictness
2. Assess team growth trajectory
3. Document environment setup pain points

### 6-Month Horizon  
1. Reconsider Poetry if team > 5 people
2. Evaluate Docker if scaling needed
3. Review ROI of implemented features

### 12-Month Horizon
1. Full technology stack review
2. Architecture evolution planning
3. Scale-appropriate tooling reassessment

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these to inform future decisions:

- **Development Velocity**: Story points per sprint
- **Bug Rate**: Production issues per release
- **Onboarding Time**: New developer productivity
- **Environment Issues**: "Works on my machine" frequency
- **Deployment Success Rate**: % successful deployments
- **Team Satisfaction**: Developer experience surveys

Remember: **Premature optimization is the root of all evil**. Your current simple, working approach is often better than complex, "perfect" solutions.
