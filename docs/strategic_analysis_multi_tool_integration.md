## 2. Memory Sharing and Context Synchronization Strategy

### Current Architecture Analysis

The existing MCP framework implements a tiered memory approach with:

- Cross-tool memory mapping via shared keys
- Scope-based memory management (session, global, user, project)
- Tool-specific adapters for consistent memory interfaces
- Keyspace partitioning with tool-specific prefixes

Key components from the current implementation:

- `UnifiedMemoryManager` provides a consistent interface across tools
- Memory scope implementation allows for different visibility levels
- Shared key mapping facilitates cross-tool memory access
- Tool-specific adapters handle the conversion between formats

### Recommended Enhancements

#### 1. Unified Memory Schema

A standardized memory schema ensures consistent representation across all tools:

```json
{
  "memory_type": "shared|tool_specific",
  "scope": "session|user|global|project",
  "priority": 1-10,
  "compression_level": 0-5,
  "ttl_seconds": 86400,
  "content": { ... },
  "metadata": {
    "source_tool": "roo|cline|gemini|copilot",
    "last_modified": "timestamp",
    "access_count": 0,
    "context_relevance": 0-1.0
  }
}
```

This schema provides:

- Clear identification of memory origin and type
- Prioritization metrics for context window management
- Metadata for intelligent pruning and synchronization
- Flexible content structure for different memory types

#### 2. Bi-Directional Synchronization Pattern

A robust synchronization mechanism ensures memory consistency across tools:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Tool A Memory] -->|Sync Event| S[Shared Memory Pool]
    B[Tool B Memory] -->|Sync Event| S
    C[Tool C Memory] -->|Sync Event| S
    S -->|Update Event| A
    S -->|Update Event| B
    S -->|Update Event| C

    S -->|Priority Token Management| T[Token Budget Optimizer]
    T -->|Context Window Management| S
```

Implementation considerations:

- Event-based synchronization triggered by memory modifications
- Optimistic concurrency control for conflict resolution
- Prioritized synchronization for frequently accessed memories
- Incremental sync for bandwidth and performance optimization

#### 3. Intelligent Context Window Management

Effective context window management is critical for optimizing tool performance:

- **Token Budgeting**: Implement dynamic token allocation based on:

  - Tool-specific context window limits
  - Task priority and complexity
  - Memory access patterns
  - Data importance/recency

- **Hierarchical Storage**:

  - Hot Memory: Frequently accessed, high-priority content (in all tools)
  - Warm Memory: Recent but not critical content (in tools with medium context)
  - Cold Memory: Historical content (primarily in Gemini's large context window)

- **Compression Strategies**:

  - Semantic compression for conceptual information
  - Summary generation for lengthy contexts
  - Reference pointers to full content in cold storage
  - Progressive compression based on access patterns

- **Adaptive Pruning**:
  - Relevance-based token budgeting
  - LRU (Least Recently Used) with priority weighting
  - Concept-aware summarization for older memories
  - Preservation of critical decision points and rationales

## 3. Task Distribution Framework
