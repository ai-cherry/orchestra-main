# Performance-Optimized MCP Framework

This document outlines the performance-optimized Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework components designed for single-developer, single-user projects. These optimizations prioritize development velocity and performance over complex security measures that create unnecessary overhead.

## Overview

The standard MCP framework includes several security layers and synchronization mechanisms that may be excessive for single-developer projects. The optimized components provide streamlined alternatives that maintain essential functionality while eliminating redundant security requirements.

## Optimized Components

### 1. Simple MCP Server (`simple_mcp.py`)

A lightweight MCP server implementation that:
- Removes complex authentication and token validation
- Simplifies CORS configuration
- Provides direct memory access without complex synchronization
- Eliminates unnecessary metadata and hash verification

Usage:
```python
from simple_mcp import SimpleMCPServer

# Create and run a simple MCP server
server = SimpleMCPServer(storage_path="./.mcp_memory", port=8080)
server.run()
```

### 2. Optimized Memory Sync (`optimized_memory_sync.py`)

A streamlined memory synchronization implementation that:
- Reduces memory scopes to just SESSION and GLOBAL
- Eliminates complex conflict resolution mechanisms
- Removes hash-based content verification
- Simplifies tool adapter interfaces

Usage:
```python
from mcp_server.optimized_memory_sync import OptimizedMemoryManager

# Create memory manager
manager = OptimizedMemoryManager()

# Register tools
roo = manager.register_tool("roo", 16000)
cline = manager.register_tool("cline", 8000)

# Share memory between tools
manager.share_memory("project_info", "AI Orchestra project", "roo")
```

### 3. Optimized IDE Integration (`optimized_ide_integration.py`)

A performance-focused IDE integration that:
- Simplifies context tracking
- Implements update throttling to reduce overhead
- Provides direct memory access
- Eliminates complex synchronization operations

Usage:
```python
from mcp_server.optimized_ide_integration import FastIDEIntegration

# Create IDE integration
integration = FastIDEIntegration()

# Handle IDE events
integration.on_file_opened("file.py", "file content")
integration.on_cursor_moved("file.py", 10, 20)

# Generate completions
completion = integration.generate_completion("Implement function")
```

### 4. Performance Configuration (`performance_config.json`)

A configuration file optimized for performance that:
- Disables unnecessary security features
- Configures caching for improved performance
- Sets appropriate update intervals for tools
- Minimizes logging overhead

### 5. Optimized Server Launcher (`run_optimized_server.py`)

A script to launch the MCP server with performance optimizations that:
- Supports different optimization profiles (memory, CPU, speed)
- Provides command-line overrides for key settings
- Simplifies server configuration

Usage:
```bash
# Run with default performance settings
python mcp_server/run_optimized_server.py

# Run with memory optimization profile
python mcp_server/run_optimized_server.py --optimize memory

# Run with speed optimization profile
python mcp_server/run_optimized_server.py --optimize speed --port 8888
```

## Performance Optimization Profiles

### Memory Profile
- Reduces cache sizes
- Disables features that consume significant memory
- Reduces context window sizes
- Suitable for environments with limited memory

### CPU Profile
- Minimizes worker count
- Increases timeouts and intervals
- Disables batch operations
- Suitable for environments with limited CPU resources

### Speed Profile
- Maximizes worker count
- Enables aggressive caching
- Minimizes update intervals
- Suitable for environments where performance is the top priority

## Security Considerations

These optimized components intentionally remove several security layers that are unnecessary for single-developer, single-user projects:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Removed token validation and complex authentication
2. **Cross-Origin Restrictions**: Simplified CORS to allow all origins
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Eliminated complex conflict resolution for multi-user scenarios
4. **Content Verification**: Removed hash-based content verification

If your project requirements change to include multiple users or deployment in a shared environment, consider re-enabling appropriate security measures.

## Usage Recommendations

1. **Local Development**: Use these optimized components for faster local development
2. **Testing**: Use for rapid testing and iteration
3. **Single-User Deployments**: Suitable for personal projects and tools
4. **Prototyping**: Ideal for rapid prototyping and proof-of-concept development

## Command-Line Options

The `run_optimized_server.py` script supports the following command-line options:

```
--config PATH      Path to configuration file
--port PORT        Port to bind to (overrides config)
--storage PATH     Path to storage directory (overrides config)
--debug            Enable debug mode
--optimize PROFILE Optimization profile to use (memory, cpu, speed)
```

## Example Workflow

1. Start the optimized MCP server:
   ```bash
   python mcp_server/run_optimized_server.py --optimize speed
   ```

2. Run the optimized memory sync demo:
   ```bash
   python mcp_server/optimized_memory_sync.py
   ```

3. Run the optimized IDE integration demo:
   ```bash
   python mcp_server/optimized_ide_integration.py
   ```

These optimized components provide a streamlined development experience for single-developer projects while maintaining the core functionality of the MCP framework.
