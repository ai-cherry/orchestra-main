### 2. Zero Junk Policy
- Transient file decorator for temporary file lifecycle management
- Cleanup registry for tracking file expiration
- Automated cleanup engine with safety checks
- Integration preference over standalone scripts

### 3. Context-Aware Generation
- Updated AI assistant configurations (, Cursor)
- Mode-specific rules and constraints
- Project structure awareness
- Existing pattern recognition

- Template generation for new scripts

### 3. Utilities

#### `core/utils/file_management.py`
- `transient_file` decorator implementation
- Cleanup registry management
- Managed file context managers
- Automatic expiration handling
- Integration with cleanup system

### 4. CI/CD Integration

#### `.github/workflows/ai_codebase_hygiene.yml`
- Weekly automated hygiene checks
- Code quality analysis
- Cleanup candidate identification
- Performance analysis
- Security scanning
- PR commenting for feedback

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
1. Core framework documentation
2. Updated AI assistant configurations
3. Cleanup and inventory scripts
4. Automation management system
5. Transient file decorator
6. GitHub Actions workflow
7. Mode-specific rules for architect and code modes

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps
1. Update remaining mode rules (debug, quality, research, etc.)
2. Create cron job configurations for automated cleanup
3. Implement monitoring dashboard
4. Train team on new processes
5. Create example implementations
6. Set up metrics collection

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Temporary File
```python
from core.utils.file_management import transient_file

@transient_file(lifetime_hours=24)
def generate_report(data: dict) -> Path:
    report_path = Path(f"reports/temp_report_{datetime.now():%Y%m%d_%H%M%S}.json")
    report_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    report_path.write_text(json.dumps(data))
    return report_path
```

### Registering an Automation Script
```bash
python scripts/automation_manager.py register \
    "Daily Cleanup" \
    "scripts/automation/daily_cleanup.py" \
    "0 3 * * *" \
    "Performs daily cleanup of expired files" \
    "devops-team"
```

### Running Cleanup Analysis
```bash
# Generate inventory
./scripts/comprehensive_inventory.sh

# Analyze cleanup candidates (dry run)
python scripts/cleanup_engine.py cleanup_inventory.json

# Execute cleanup
python scripts/cleanup_engine.py cleanup_inventory.json --execute
```

## Success Metrics

### Short-term (1 month)
- [ ] 50% reduction in temporary files without lifecycle
- [ ] 100% of new automation scripts registered
- [ ] Zero critical file deletions
- [ ] 90% team adoption rate

### Medium-term (3 months)
- [ ] 80% of AI-generated files using lifecycle management
- [ ] <1 standalone script created per month
- [ ] 99% automation script success rate
- [ ] 25% reduction in repository size

### Long-term (6 months)
- [ ] Technical debt ratio <5%
- [ ] P99 latency maintained or improved
- [ ] Zero incidents from obsolete scripts
- [ ] Full team proficiency

## Team Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Always use `transient_file` decorator for temporary files
2. Integrate utilities into existing modules
3. Register automation scripts properly
4. Follow performance requirements
5. Use centralized logging

### For AI Assistants
1. Check existing modules before creating new code
2. Ask about file lifecycle when creating files
3. Suggest integration over standalone scripts
4. Include performance considerations
5. Follow project structure

### For DevOps
1. Schedule cleanup scripts via cron
2. Monitor automation health regularly
3. Review cleanup candidates weekly
4. Maintain automation registry
5. Track performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cleanup script flags important file**
   - Add to PROTECTED_PATTERNS in cleanup_engine.py
   - Use git to track the file
   - Add expiration metadata to file

2. **Automation script fails**
   - Check health file in status/automation_health/
   - Review logs in logs/automation/
   - Update script registration if schedule changed

3. **Transient file not cleaned up**
   - Verify file was created with decorator
   - Check .cleanup_registry.json
   - Run cleanup_expired_files_task manually
