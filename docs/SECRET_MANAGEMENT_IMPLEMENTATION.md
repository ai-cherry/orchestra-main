# Secret Management CI/CD Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the implementation of secret management in our CI/CD pipeline. The integration allows secure handling of API keys and other sensitive credentials during deployment, using GitHub Actions and Google Cloud Secret Manager.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Files Created or Modified

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**

  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: Configured for secret management integration

- **Scripts**

  - `scripts/pre-commit-hook-template`: Template for preventing accidental commits of secret files
  - `scripts/install-pre-commit-hook.sh`: Helper script for developers to install the pre-commit hook
  - `scripts/validate_secret_cicd.sh`: Validation script to check the integration

- **Documentation**

  - `docs/SECRET_MANAGEMENT_CICD.md`: Comprehensive documentation for the CI/CD integration
  - `README.md`: Updated with information about the secret management features

- **Examples**
  - `examples/local_secret_setup_example.sh`: Example script for local testing

### 2. Integration Flow

1. **Authentication**: The workflow authenticates with GCP using a service account key stored in GitHub Secrets
2. **Secret File Creation**: Creates a temporary file from GitHub Secrets during the build
3. **Secret Management**: Uses `secrets_setup.sh` to create/update secrets in GCP Secret Manager
4. **Cleanup**: Removes temporary files to maintain security
5. **Deployment**: Deploys to Cloud Run with the secret injected as an environment variable

### 3. Required GitHub Secrets

- `PORTKEY_KEY_CONTENT`: The raw content of the Portkey API key file
- `GCP_SA_KEY_6833bc94f0e3ef8648efc1578caa23ba2b8a8a52`: The GCP service account JSON key

### 4. Service Accounts and Permissions

- **vertex-agent@cherry-ai-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com**:

  - Used for managing secrets with Secret Manager
  - Requires `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` and `roles/aiplatform.reasoningEngineServiceAgent`

- **orchestra-cloud-run-prod@cherry-ai-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com**:
  - Runtime service account for Cloud Run
  - Needs access to the secrets during runtime

## Testing and Validation

The integration includes a validation script (`scripts/validate_secret_cicd.sh`) that checks:

- Presence of all required files
- Executable permissions
- Essential content in configuration files
- GCP permissions (when available)

## Developer Workflow

1. **Local Development**:

   - Install the pre-commit hook using `./scripts/install-pre-commit-hook.sh`
   - Use the example script for local testing: `examples/local_secret_setup_example.sh`

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Push changes to trigger the workflow
   - Secrets are automatically managed in the pipeline
   - Cloud Run deployment receives the secrets as environment variables

## Security Considerations

- Secrets are never committed to the repository
- Temporary files are cleaned up immediately after use
- Access is controlled through IAM permissions
- Pre-commit hooks provide an additional layer of protection

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Secret Rotation**: Implement automatic rotation of sensitive credentials
2. **Additional Secrets**: Extend the pattern to handle multiple secrets
3. **Secret Version Management**: Track and manage secret versions
4. **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging for secret access
