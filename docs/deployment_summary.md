# Deployment Summary for FastAPI Backend

This document provides an overview of the deployment process for the Orchestra FastAPI backend and references to the detailed documentation.

## Overview of Deployment Resources

We've created the following resources to help you deploy your FastAPI backend:

1. **Documentation**:
   - [Local API Testing Guide](local_api_testing.md) - Instructions for testing your API locally
   - [Cloud Run Deployment Guide](cloud_run_deployment.md) - Step-by-step guide for deploying to Cloud Run
   - [Infrastructure Documentation](infra.md) - General information about the infrastructure setup
   - [Infrastructure Migration Guide](infra_migration_guide.md) - Guide for migrating from the custom approach to standard Terraform

2. **Scripts**:
   - `deploy_to_cloud_run.sh` - One-command deployment script
   - `infra/setup_remote_state.sh` - Script to set up remote Terraform state in GCS
   - `infra/test_plan.sh` - Script to validate Terraform configurations

3. **Infrastructure Configurations**:
   - `infra/dev/main.tf` - Terraform configuration for the development environment
   - `infra/prod/main.tf` - Terraform configuration for the production environment
   - `infra/modules/*` - Reusable Terraform modules

## Deployment Workflow

Here's the recommended workflow for deploying your FastAPI backend:

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure your API works locally
   ./run_api.sh
   # Test API endpoints
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

2. **Automated Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy to development environment
   ./deploy_to_cloud_run.sh
   ```

3. **Manual Deployment** (alternative):
   - Follow the steps in [Cloud Run Deployment Guide](cloud_run_deployment.md)

## Environment Management

The infrastructure is organized by environment:

- **Development** (`infra/dev/`): For testing and development
- **Production** (`infra/prod/`): For live, user-facing services

Each environment has its own Terraform configuration but shares the same modules.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/terraform.yml`) has been set up to handle CI/CD for the infrastructure:

- On pull requests: Validates Terraform configurations
- On merge to main: Deploys to development, then prompts for production deployment approval

## Next Steps

After deploying your API to Cloud Run, you should:

1. **Connect Frontend**: Update your admin website to connect to the deployed API endpoint
2. **Set Up Monitoring**: Configure Cloud Monitoring to track API performance
3. **Configure Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for your API if needed

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check the logs: `gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=orchestrator-api-dev" --limit=10`
2. Refer to the troubleshooting sections in the documentation
3. Use Google Cloud Console to inspect your Cloud Run service and logs
