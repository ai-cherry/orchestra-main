## Mode Configurations

### Model Assignments

We've optimized the AI model assignments based on each mode's primary function:

| Mode            | Model          | Context Window | Specialization                                      |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 💻 Code         | GPT-4.1        | 128K tokens    | Implementation-focused with strong coding abilities |
| 🪲 Debug        | GPT-4.1        | 128K tokens    | Error analysis and runtime diagnostics              |
| 🏗 Architect    | Gemini 2.5 Pro | 1M+ tokens     | System design with large context awareness          |

  - `.md` files
  - `infrastructure/*.yaml` files
  - `config/*.yaml` files
  - `docs/*` files

- **🪃 Orchestrator**: Can now perform automated fixes to code issues

  - `.py` files (for automated fixes)
  - `.md` files (for documentation updates)
  - `.json` files (for configuration updates)

  - `roadmap/*` files

- **🎨 Creative**: Can now create and modify documentation
  - `.md` files
  - `docs/*` files
  - `README.*` files

## Workflow Orchestration

The system now supports predefined workflows - sequences of mode transitions designed for specific development tasks. Each workflow defines a series of steps with specific tasks to accomplish.

### Available Workflows

1. **Feature Development Workflow**

   - Step 1: Strategy (Planning)
   - Step 2: Architect (Design)
   - Step 3: Code (Implementation)
   - Step 4: Orchestrator (Review)
   - Step 5: Debug (Testing)
   - Step 6: Creative (Documentation)

2. **Bug Fix Workflow**

   - Step 1: Debug (Analysis)
   - Step 2: Code (Fix Implementation)
   - Step 3: Orchestrator (Review)

3. **Refactoring Workflow**

   - Step 1: Orchestrator (Analysis)
   - Step 2: Architect (Design)
   - Step 3: Code (Implementation)
   - Step 4: Debug (Testing)
   - Step 5: Creative (Documentation)

4. **Security Audit Workflow**
   - Step 1: Orchestrator (Analysis)
   - Step 2: Debug (Verification)
   - Step 3: Code (Implementation)
   - Step 4: Reviewer (Validation)

### Using Workflows

Workflows can be started using the Mode Switcher tool:

```bash
python tools/mode_switcher.py --workflow feature_development
```

Or interactively:

```bash
python tools/mode_switcher.py --interactive
```

## Recommended Mode Chaining Strategies

Beyond the predefined workflows, here are strategic approaches for chaining modes for larger project components:

### API Development Chain

For developing new API endpoints or services:

1. **🧠 Strategy**: Define the API interface, requirements, and integration points
2. **🏗 Architect**: Design the API structure, database schema, and data flow
3. **💻 Code**: Implement the FastAPI endpoints, data models, and services
4. **🪲 Debug**: Test the API endpoints for edge cases and error handling
5. **🪃 Orchestrator**: Review the implementation for quality and security
6. **🎨 Creative**: Create API documentation and usage examples

###
For setting up or modifying
1. **🏗 Architect**: Design the infrastructure components and dependencies
2. **💻 Code**: Implement the Terraform/HCL code for the infrastructure
3. **🪃 Orchestrator**: Review for security best practices and compliance
4. **🪲 Debug**: Test deployments in a staging environment
5. **🕵️ Reviewer**: Validate the infrastructure against requirements

### AI Model Integration Chain

For integrating new AI models or capabilities:

1. **❓ Ask**: Research available models, capabilities, and limitations
2. **🧠 Strategy**: Plan the integration approach and evaluation criteria
3. **🏗 Architect**: Design the integration points and data flow
4. **💻 Code**: Implement the model integration and service endpoints
5. **🪲 Debug**: Test the model performance and error cases
6. **🪃 Orchestrator**: Review for optimizations and best practices
7. **🕵️ Reviewer**: Validate model behavior against requirements

## Best Practices for Mode Transitions

1. **Save Context Between Transitions**: The mode system now automatically preserves workflow state between transitions.

2. **Complete Tasks Before Transitioning**: Each mode should complete its designated task before switching to the next mode.

3. **Leverage Suggested Transitions**: Use the suggestion feature to determine the next appropriate mode based on your current task.

4. **Document Transition Decisions**: When deviating from predefined workflows, document the reason for choosing a different mode transition.

5. **Use Specialized Modes for Specialized Tasks**: Don't use Code mode for everything - leverage the specialized capabilities of each mode.

## Configuration

The mode system configuration is defined in `config/mode_definitions.yaml`. You can customize mode capabilities, file patterns, and workflows by editing this file.

## Future Mode Recommendations

Based on analysis of the AI Orchestra project, we recommend considering these additional modes:

1. **📊 MLOps Mode**: Specialized in AI model deployment, versioning, and monitoring

   - Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro (for large context understanding)
   - Focus: AI pipeline optimization, model performance metrics, dataset management

2. **🔐 Security Mode**: Dedicated to security audits and vulnerability management

   - Model: GPT-4.1 (for precise vulnerability detection)
   - Focus: Security scanning, vulnerability remediation, compliance checking

3. **📡 Integration Mode**: Specialized in third-party API integration

   - Model: Claude 3.7 (for context understanding of external systems)
   - Focus: API client implementation, authentication flow, data mapping

4. **🧪 Testing Mode**: Focused on test case generation and validation
   - Model: GPT-4.1 (for precise test case generation)
   - Focus: Unit tests, integration tests, test coverage analysis

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Mode System transforms Roo from a collection of specialized assistants into a coordinated team with seamless transitions and context retention. By assigning the most appropriate model to each mode and enabling cross-mode workflows, we can tackle larger, more complex tasks while maintaining context and quality throughout the development process.
