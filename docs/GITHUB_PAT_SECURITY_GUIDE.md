# GitHub PAT Security Management Guide for AI Orchestra

This guide explains the secure PAT (Personal Access Token) management system implemented for the AI Orchestra project, including the tiered token approach, automated rotation, and security-optimized CI/CD workflows.

## Overview

The PAT Management System implements a least-privilege security approach for GitHub interactions while balancing the practical needs of CI/CD workflows. It includes:

1. **Tiered PAT Management**: Different tokens with specific permission scopes
2. **Automated Token Rotation**: Scheduled refreshing of tokens to minimize security risks
3. **Security-Optimized Workflows**: Templates that follow security best practices
4. **Validation Tools**: Testing framework to verify workflow security

## Tiered PAT System

### Token Tiers

The system uses multiple token types with different permission levels:

| Token Type | Purpose | Permissions | Rotation Frequency |
|------------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| `read` | Read-only operations | repo status, public repos, read packages | 180 days |
| `write_packages` | Package publishing | repo, write packages | 90 days |
| `workflow` | Workflow operations | repo, workflow, packages | 60 days |
| `deployment` | Production deployments | repo, workflow, packages, hooks | 30 days |

### Using the PAT Manager

The `PATManager` class in `secret-management/pat_manager.py` provides an API for interacting with tokens securely. It ensures tokens are stored securely and retrieved based on the principle of least privilege.

## Automated PAT Rotation

PATs are automatically rotated based on their expiration schedule using the `.github/workflows/pat-rotation-automation.yml` workflow. This helps limit the window of exposure if tokens are compromised.

## Security-Optimized Workflows

The `.github/workflows/security-optimized-template.yml` provides a template that includes:

- Limited permissions following least-privilege principles
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Proper timeout limits
- Environment-specific deployments
- Post-deployment verification

## Workflow Validation

The validation framework in `tests/workflow_validation/test_github_actions.py` checks for:

1. **Permission Settings**: Ensuring restricted permissions
2. **Timeout Limits**: Preventing runaway jobs
3. **Action Pinning**: Using specific versions instead of floating references
4. **Secret Handling**: Preventing accidental exposure
5. **Environment Protection**: Using environment protection rules

## Best Practices

### PAT Security

1. **Never share PATs** across projects or with other users
2. **Never commit PATs** to Git repositories
3. **Always use the lowest-privilege token** for the task at hand
4. **Monitor PAT usage** through GitHub audit logs

### Workflow Security

1. **Pin action versions** to specific commits or version numbers
2. **Set timeout limits** for all workflow jobs
3. **Use environment protection rules** for deployment jobs
4. **Validate workflow changes** before merging
5. **Never echo secrets** in workflow steps
