## Technology Stack Update

- **Docker / docker-compose**: Permitted and recommended for local development, service coordination, and consistent environment setup. Use official Python 3.10 base images, minimize layers, and follow security best practices.
- **Redis**: Permitted and recommended for general-purpose caching (key-value with TTLs) and semantic caching (using Redis Stack or vector search modules). Configure for performance and resource limits. Not for use as a primary database.
