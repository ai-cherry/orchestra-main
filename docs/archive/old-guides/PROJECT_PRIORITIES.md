# Project Priorities: Performance Over Security

This document establishes the core priorities for the AI Orchestra project. As a single-developer project, our focus is on optimizing for **performance, stability, and rapid development** rather than implementing extensive security measures.

## Core Priorities

1. **Performance & Optimization**: Optimizing for speed, resource efficiency, and scalability
2. **Deployment Stability**: Ensuring reliable and consistent deployments
3. **Developer Experience**: Streamlining workflows and reducing friction
4. **Basic Security Compliance**: Implementing essential security (enough to pass GitHub filters)

## Security Philosophy

This project intentionally adopts a "security-sufficient" approach rather than a "security-first" approach:

- **Current Phase**: Basic security measures that don't impede development
- **Future Phase**: Enhanced security once the project is stable and handling sensitive data

## Guidelines for AI Assistants (Gemini, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

When generating code, documentation, or infrastructure definitions:

1. **Prioritize Performance**: Suggest optimizations for speed and efficiency
2. **Suggest Simple Solutions**: Avoid over-engineering with complex security patterns
3. **Focus on Stability**: Emphasize robust error handling and reliability
4. **Apply Basic Security**: Implement only essential security practices
   - No hardcoded credentials
   - Basic input validation
   - Standard authentication
   - Enough to pass standard GitHub security filters
5. **Real-World Implementation Access**: AI tools have access to GitHub and GCP via organization secrets
   - Available tokens: `GH_CLASSIC_PAT_TOKEN`, `GH_FINE_GRAINED_TOKEN`, `GCP_MASTER_SERVICE_JSON`, etc.
   - These tokens can be used to make actual changes to repos and cloud resources

## When NOT to Focus on Security

- When implementing internal components not exposed to the internet
- During rapid prototyping and early development stages
- When the security measure would significantly impact performance
- When the security measure adds unnecessary complexity for a single-developer project

## When Basic Security IS Required

- User authentication and authorization
- API endpoints exposed to the public internet
- Storage of any sensitive data (even in development)
- Deployment pipelines and infrastructure as code

## Real-World Integration Capabilities

AI assistants working on this project have authorization to:

1. **Make direct changes** to GitHub repositories via the provided tokens
2. **Deploy and configure** GCP resources using the provided service account keys
3. **Update project configurations** and settings as needed

When suggesting changes, AI assistants should:

- Provide clear implementation steps using available tokens
- Explain what changes will be made to cloud resources
- Default to optimized configurations rather than security-focused ones

## Applying This Philosophy

This philosophy should be reflected in:

- Code reviews and suggestions
- Infrastructure as code templates
- Deployment workflows
- Documentation
- Dependency choices

## Future Evolution

As the project matures:

1. Security measures will be incrementally enhanced
2. Performance optimizations will remain a priority
3. The balance will shift when production data becomes more sensitive

**Note to AI Assistants**: This document supersedes general security best practices typically suggested for production applications. When in doubt about prioritizing security versus performance, default to performance optimizations for this project.
