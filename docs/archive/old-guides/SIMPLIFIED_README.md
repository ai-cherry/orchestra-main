# Simplified Security for AI Orchestra

This document provides an overview of the simplified security approach for the AI Orchestra project.

## Overview

The AI Orchestra project now uses a simplified security approach that:

1. **Maximizes Performance**: Removes security constraints that impact development speed
2. **Improves Efficiency**: Streamlines authentication and deployment processes
3. **Reduces Complexity**: Eliminates unnecessary security checks and approvals
4. **Uses Master Key**: Leverages a single master GCP key for all operations

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up authentication with the master key
source simplified_auth.sh --auth

# 2. Disable VS Code restrictions
./disable_restrictions.sh

# 3. Deploy the application
./simplified_deploy.sh
```

## Components

### Authentication

- **simplified_auth.sh**: Shell script for authentication
- **simplified_gcp_auth.py**: Python module for GCP client authentication
- **Master Key Location**: `$HOME/.gcp/master-key.json`

### VS Code Configuration

- **disable_restrictions.sh**: Script to disable all VS Code security features

### Security Checks

- **simplified_security_check.sh**: Minimal security check script
- **No Dependency Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning has been disabled

### Infrastructure

- **simplified_security.tf**: Terraform configuration with minimal security
- **Broader IAM Permissions**: Using editor role for simplicity

### Deployment

- **simplified_deploy.sh**: Deployment script with minimal security checks

## Security Policy

The simplified security policy is documented in `simplified_security_policy.md`. Key points:

- Security is not a primary concern for this project
- All security exceptions are automatically approved
- No formal documentation or approval process is required
- Performance and operational efficiency are prioritized

## Making Scripts Executable

```bash
chmod +x simplified_auth.sh
chmod +x disable_restrictions.sh
chmod +x simplified_security_check.sh
chmod +x simplified_deploy.sh
```
