# 🎼 Orchestra AI Development Workflow & Branch Strategy
*Comprehensive Guide to Prevent Environment Confusion and Ensure Clean Development*

**Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Status**: Active Development Strategy  
**Priority**: Critical Infrastructure

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document establishes comprehensive best practices for Orchestra AI development to prevent environment confusion, maintain clean workflows, and ensure safe integration of complex infrastructure components like the discovered MCP server ecosystem.

## 🚨 Current Environment Status

### **✅ WORKING SERVICES**
```yaml
Frontend (React + Vite): http://localhost:3000 ✅ OPERATIONAL
API Server (FastAPI): http://localhost:8000/api/health ✅ OPERATIONAL
Development Environment: ✅ STABLE
Documentation: ✅ COMPREHENSIVE
```

### **⚠️ PENDING INTEGRATION**
```yaml
MCP Server Ecosystem: 🔄 DISCOVERED IN IaC BRANCH
Lambda Labs Infrastructure: 🔄 REQUIRES INTEGRATION  
Advanced Development Tools: 🔄 STAGING FOR DEPLOYMENT
Production Pipelines: 🔄 READY FOR ACTIVATION
```

## 🌿 Branch Management Strategy

### **Primary Branch Structure**
```
main (production-ready)
├── feature/mcp-integration (active development)
├── feature/lambda-labs-setup (infrastructure)
├── hotfix/* (emergency fixes)
└── develop (integration testing)
```

### **Branch Protection Rules**

#### **🔒 MAIN Branch (Sacred)**
- **Protected**: No direct commits
- **Requires**: Pull request with reviews
- **Tested**: All CI/CD checks must pass
- **Stable**: Only production-ready code
- **Deployment**: Auto-deploys to production

#### **🚧 Feature Branches**
- **Naming**: `feature/descriptive-name`
- **Lifespan**: Short-lived (max 2 weeks)
- **Base**: Always from latest `main`
- **Testing**: Local testing required before PR

#### **🆘 Hotfix Branches**
- **Naming**: `hotfix/issue-description`
- **Base**: From `main` branch
- **Merge**: Direct to `main` after testing
- **Notification**: Immediate team alert

### **Critical IaC Branch Handling**
```bash
# SAFE Integration Process
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/mcp-integration
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/codex/integrate-customized-iac-agent-mode -- [specific-files]
# Test thoroughly before committing
```

## 🛡️ Environment Isolation Strategy

### **Development Environment Layers**

#### **Layer 1: Local Development**
```yaml
Purpose: Individual developer work
Isolation: Complete local environment
Database: SQLite (api/database/sqlite_connection.py)
Services: Local ports only (3000, 8000)
MCP: Disabled by default
```

#### **Layer 2: Integration Testing**
```yaml  
Purpose: Feature integration testing
Isolation: Shared development database
Database: PostgreSQL (with proper connection)
Services: Extended port range (8000-8014)
MCP: Basic servers enabled
```

#### **Layer 3: Staging**
```yaml
Purpose: Production simulation
Isolation: Production-like environment
Database: Full PostgreSQL + Redis + Weaviate
Services: Complete MCP ecosystem
Lambda Labs: GPU instances enabled
```

#### **Layer 4: Production**
```yaml
Purpose: Live system
Isolation: Complete production isolation  
Database: Full stack with backups
Services: All MCP servers + monitoring
Infrastructure: Lambda Labs + auto-scaling
```

## 🔧 Development Environment Best Practices

### **Startup Sequence (Safe)**
```bash
# 1. Environment Check
./setup_dev_environment.sh --verify

# 2. Clean Startup
./start_orchestra.sh --clean

# 3. Health Verification
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl http://localhost:3000
```

### **Error Prevention Checklist**
- [ ] Virtual environment activated
- [ ] Dependencies up to date (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Ports available (no conflicts)
- [ ] Database accessible
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Git status clean

### **Daily Development Workflow**
```bash
# Morning Startup
git status                          # Check for uncommitted changes
git pull origin main               # Get latest updates
./start_orchestra.sh              # Start all services
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health  # Verify backend

# During Development
git checkout -b feature/my-feature  # Create feature branch
# ... development work ...
./test_setup.py                   # Run environment tests

# End of Day
git add .                          # Stage changes
git commit -m "descriptive message"  # Commit work
git push origin feature/my-feature   # Push to remote
./stop_all_services.sh            # Clean shutdown
```

## 🔒 Safety Protocols

### **Before Making Changes**
1. **Environment Backup**
   ```bash
   git stash push -m "backup before changes"
   cp -r .env .env.backup
   ```

2. **Health Check**
   ```bash
   ./test_setup.py --comprehensive
   ```

3. **Service Status**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep -E "(python|node|uvicorn)" | grep -v grep
   ```

### **Emergency Recovery Procedures**

#### **🚨 Environment Corruption**
```bash
# Stop all services
pkill -f "python.*orchestra"
pkill -f "node.*vite"

# Reset to known good state
git stash
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# Clean restart
./setup_dev_environment.sh --force
./start_orchestra.sh --clean
```

#### **🚨 Port Conflicts**
```bash
# Find and kill conflicting processes
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Clean restart with port verification
./start_orchestra.sh --check-ports
```

#### **🚨 Database Issues**
```bash
# Switch to SQLite backup
export USE_SQLITE=true
./start_api.sh --simple

# Or reset database
./setup_sqlite_database.sh --reset
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Alerts

### **Development Monitoring**
```yaml
Services:
  - API Health: http://localhost:8000/api/health
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - Hot Reload: Automatic file watching

Alerts:
  - Service down: Immediate terminal notification
  - Import errors: Detailed error logging
  - Port conflicts: Automatic resolution attempts
```

### **Integration Monitoring**
```yaml
MCP Servers:
  - Status endpoint: http://localhost:8000/mcp/status
  - Health checks: Every 30 seconds
  - Resource usage: Memory and CPU tracking

Alerts:
  - MCP server down: Automatic restart attempt
  - Resource threshold: Warning at 80% usage
  - Communication failure: Detailed error logs
```
