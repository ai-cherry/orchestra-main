     - Always test changes on staging server first
     - Use blue-green deployment strategies
     - Implement proper rollback procedures
     - Monitor system health during deployments
     - Maintain deployment logs and documentation
  
  2. **Pulumi Infrastructure as Code:**
     - Use TypeScript or Python for Pulumi scripts
     - Tag all resources appropriately for cost tracking
     - Implement proper resource dependencies
     - Use stack configurations for different environments
     - Version control all infrastructure code
  
  3. **Server Management:**

  4. **GitHub Actions CI/CD:**
     - Use organization secrets for sensitive data
     - Implement proper error handling in workflows
     - Use matrix builds for multiple environments
     - Include security scanning in pipelines
     - Cache dependencies for faster builds
  
  5. **Monitoring & Alerting:**
