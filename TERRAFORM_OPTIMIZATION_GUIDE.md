# Terraform Infrastructure Optimization Guide

This guide documents the optimizations and improvements made to the Terraform infrastructure setup to enhance performance, reliability, and maintainability.

## Performance Optimizations

### Parallelism Configuration

We've increased the default parallelism settings to speed up plan and apply operations:

- Global `.terraformrc` configuration sets default parallelism to 10
- CI/CD pipeline and helper script allow custom parallelism settings
- Environment variables control performance parameters: `TF_PARALLELISM=10`

### Caching Enhancements

Plugin caching has been implemented to reduce download times:

- Provider plugins are cached in `~/.terraform.d/plugin-cache`
- CI/CD pipeline uses GitHub Actions cache to persist plugins between runs
- Lock files are committed to ensure consistent plugin versions

### Resource Dependencies

- Circular dependencies have been resolved by refactoring module structure
- Clear separation between environment-specific and shared resources
- Optimized data source usage to reduce API calls during planning

## CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements

The GitHub Actions workflow has been improved for reliability and speed:

### Matrix Strategy for Environments

- Parallel planning across environments (common, dev, prod)
- Independent validation jobs to catch errors early
- Isolated apply operations with proper dependency management

### Security Integration

- Workload Identity Federation for secure GCP authentication
- Approval gates for production deployments
- Security scanning integrated into the pipeline

### PR Enhancements

- Detailed plan outputs in PR comments
- Status checks for validation and security compliance
- Support for manual triggering via workflow_dispatch

## Module Organization

The module structure has been refactored to improve maintainability:

```
infra/terraform/
├── gcp/
│   ├── modules/
│   │   ├── firestore/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── environments/
│       ├── common/
│       ├── dev/
│       └── prod/
```

### Module Best Practices

- Each module has consistent structure with main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf
- Clear documentation in module variables and outputs
- Version constraints for all providers
- Standard naming conventions enforced by linting

## Security Scanning

Multiple security scanning tools have been integrated:

### tfsec

- Static analysis for security issues
- Integrated into CI/CD pipeline 
- Configuration in .tflint.hcl

### Checkov

- Policy-as-code scanning
- Comprehensive security and compliance checks
- Integrated into CI/CD as a pre-deployment step

## Helper Tools

Several helper tools have been created for development efficiency:

### terraform-optimizer.sh

A comprehensive script for managing Terraform operations:

- Unified interface for init, plan, apply across environments
- Automatic state backup and restoration
- Advanced logging and error handling
- Performance optimization parameters

### .terraformrc

Global configuration for Terraform CLI:

- Plugin caching
- Credential management
- Parallelism settings
- Telemetry control

## State Management

Improved state management practices:

### Backup Strategy

- Automatic state backups before operations
- Restoration capability for recovery scenarios
- Logged operations for audit trail

### Backend Configuration

- GCS backend with proper encryption
- Environment-specific state separation
- Lock file handling to prevent concurrent operations

## Best Practices

The project now adheres to these Terraform best practices:

### Code Quality

- Standard formatting enforced via `terraform fmt` in CI
- Naming conventions enforced via TFLint
- Comprehensive documentation for all resources

### Security

- Least privilege principle for service accounts
- Secret management via Secret Manager
- Enhanced protection for production resources

### Performance

- Resource grouping to minimize API calls
- Caching strategies for providers and data sources
- Parallel execution where possible

## Usage Instructions

### Local Development

1. Use the terraform-optimizer.sh script for local operations:

```bash
# Initialize all environments
./terraform-optimizer.sh init all

# Plan changes for dev environment
./terraform-optimizer.sh plan dev

# Apply changes to a specific environment with parallelism
./terraform-optimizer.sh -j 20 apply dev

# Create backups before operations
./terraform-optimizer.sh -b plan prod
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow automates:

1. Validation and linting
2. Security scanning
3. Planning for PRs
4. Application for merged changes to main branch

View the workflow status in the GitHub Actions tab for detailed logs and outputs.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Circular dependencies**: If you encounter circular dependency errors, review module references and use data sources instead of direct references where appropriate.

2. **Authentication failures**: Check service account permissions and key availability. The workflow uses Workload Identity Federation, while local development may use Application Default Credentials.

3. **State locking**: If state is locked, verify no concurrent operations are running. Use `force-unlock` only as a last resort.
