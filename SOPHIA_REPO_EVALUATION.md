# Repository Structure Evaluation for SOPHIA

This document reviews the current repository layout to verify alignment with the SOPHIA system architecture.

## Top-Level Directories
- **airbyte/** – Configuration for data ingestion pipelines. This matches the Snowflake ETL requirements.
- **api/** – FastAPI application providing chat, search, and persona endpoints.
- **auth/** – Authentication helpers for secure API usage.
- **database/** – SQLAlchemy models and migrations. Supports PostgreSQL and Snowflake integration.
- **integrations/** – External service integrations, including recent Snowflake and Sentry loaders.
- **mcp_servers/** – Model Context Protocol servers for running specialized AI agents.
- **monitoring/** – Prometheus/Grafana configs and Sentry setup for observability.
- **scripts/** – Helper scripts for deployment and environment validation.
- **services/** – Background services such as caching and memory management.
- **src/** – Main Flask/FastAPI application source code.
- **tests/** – Unit and integration tests covering API and core logic.
- **web/** – React-based admin interface for chat and system management.

## Alignment with SOPHIA Overview
- **Data Ingestion**: The `airbyte/` directory and Snowflake loader scripts provide ETL pipelines from external sources as described.
- **LLM & AI Stack**: The presence of `mcp_servers/`, `premium_persona_orchestrators.py`, and Portkey configuration files demonstrates multiple AI backends and orchestrator integration.
- **Interface Design**: The `web/` directory implements a chat-based admin interface built with React, matching the requirement for a dynamic search/chat UI.
- **AI Agents & Workflows**: Specialized agent scripts (`specialized_agents.py`, `premium_specialized_agents.py`) and persona orchestrators align with the described agents (Sales Coach, Client Health, etc.).
- **Knowledge Base & Documentation**: Extensive Markdown documentation across the repository provides guidance and reference materials, fulfilling the knowledge base requirement.
- **Strategic Layer**: Database models and analytics scripts allow evaluation of employee performance and strategic metrics.
- **Communication & Rollout**: Slack integrations and monitoring scripts feed system updates to the team, supporting real-time notifications.

Overall, the repository structure aligns with the SOPHIA architecture and provides the necessary components for data ingestion, AI orchestration, admin interface, and documentation.
