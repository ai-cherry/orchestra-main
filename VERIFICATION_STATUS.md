# Orchestra AI - Verification Status Report
Date: January 14, 2025

## üîç Verification Results

### ‚úÖ Working Components

1. **GitHub Repository**
   - Successfully pushed all changes to main branch
   - Repository: https://github.com/ai-cherry/orchestra-main
   - Commit includes enhanced API proxy, health monitoring, and development tools

2. **Lambda Backend**
   - Status: **HEALTHY** ‚úÖ
   - URL: http://150.136.94.139:8000
   - Health endpoint: http://150.136.94.139:8000/health
   - Response: `{"status": "healthy", "service": "orchestra-api", "version": "2.0.0"}`

3. **Code Enhancements**
   - Enhanced API proxy with caching and request tracking
   - Created useHealthCheck React hook
   - Added development scripts (dev.sh, orchestra_service_manager.sh)
   - Updated .gitignore to exclude venv and temporary files

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

1. **Vercel Deployment**
   - Latest deployment (4sq7ltzs8) is still building after 4+ minutes
   - Previous deployments have authentication enabled (Vercel SSO)
   - Some recent deployments failed with errors

2. **Python Path Issues**
   - System uses `python3` instead of `python`
   - Scripts need to be updated to use `python3` explicitly
   - Virtual environment activation works correctly

3. **API Proxy Path**
   - Backend health endpoint is at `/health` not `/api/health`
   - Fixed in dev.sh script

### üìä Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Backend API | ‚úÖ Healthy | Running on Lambda at 150.136.94.139:8000 |
| Vercel Deployment | ‚è≥ Building | https://orchestra-ai-admin-4sq7ltzs8-lynn-musils-projects.vercel.app |
| GitHub | ‚úÖ Updated | All changes pushed successfully |
| Local Dev Scripts | ‚úÖ Fixed | Updated to use correct paths and python3 |

### üîß Fixes Applied

1. Updated `dev.sh` to use correct health endpoint path
2. All Python scripts should use `python3` command
3. Added proper error handling in API proxy

### üìù Next Steps

1. **Wait for Vercel deployment to complete**
   - Monitor with: `vercel ls | grep "4sq7ltzs8"`
   - Check logs if deployment fails: `vercel logs [deployment-url]`

2. **Configure Vercel authentication**
   - The deployments have SSO protection enabled
   - Need to configure proper authentication settings in Vercel dashboard

3. **Test the deployment once ready**
   ```bash
   # Test API proxy
   curl https://orchestra-ai-admin.vercel.app/api/health
   
   # Check frontend
   open https://orchestra-ai-admin.vercel.app
   ```

4. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   # Start all services locally
   ./dev.sh
   
   # Or manage individually
   ./orchestra_service_manager.sh start
   ./orchestra_service_manager.sh status
   ```

### üöÄ Production URLs

- **Admin Interface**: https://orchestra-ai-admin.vercel.app (pending deployment)
- **Backend API**: http://150.136.94.139:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://150.136.94.139:8000/docs

### ‚ú® Summary

The core infrastructure is working correctly:
- Backend API is healthy and responsive
- Code improvements have been implemented and pushed to GitHub
- Vercel deployment is in progress

The main pending item is the Vercel deployment completion and authentication configuration.
