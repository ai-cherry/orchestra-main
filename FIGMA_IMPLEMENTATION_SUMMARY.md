# Figma Implementation Summary

## What's Been Accomplished

We've successfully prepared all the necessary files for setting up your Figma project structure:

1. **Page Structure Setup Script**
   - Created Python script (`setup_figma_pages.py`) configured with your Figma ID (`368236963`)
   - Supports multiple authentication methods for flexibility
   - Properly handles API interactions, error reporting, and rate limiting

2. **Design System Components**
   - Verified `figma-variables-spec.json` with color system for multiple personas:
     - Neutral, Cherry, Sophia, and Gordon Gekko themes
     - Accent colors (primary, secondary, text)
     - Typography specifications
   
   - Confirmed `component-adaptation-mapping.json` with detailed mapping for:
     - Button (Primary)
     - Card (Default)
     - Input (Default)
     - Sidebar Item
     - Top Bar Container

3. **Dashboard Design Specification**
   - Verified `figma-first-draft-prompt.txt` with complete guidelines for:
     - Layout structure and measurements
     - Key interface elements
     - Visual styling
     - Color scheme and typography

## How to Execute the Setup

### 1. Setting Up Pages

Run the Python script to create all the pages in your Figma file:

```bash
# Method 1: Provide PAT directly
python3 setup_figma_pages.py YOUR_FIGMA_PAT

# Method 2: Use environment variable (best for CI/CD)
export FIGMA_PAT='your-figma-pat-here'
python3 setup_figma_pages.py
```

This will create the following pages in your Figma file:
- _Foundations & Variables
- _Core Components [Adapted]
- Web - Dashboard
- Web - Agents
- Web - Personas
- Web - Memory
- Web - Projects
- Web - Settings
- Web - TrainingGround
- Android - Core Screens
- Prototypes
- Archive

### 2. Creating Variables

After the pages are created, you'll need to:

1. Open your Figma file (ID: 368236963)
2. Navigate to the "Variables" panel
3. Create the Orchestra-Color-Semantic collection with four modes:
   - Neutral (default with purple accent)
   - Cherry (pink accent)
   - Sophia (blue accent)
   - Gordon Gekko (orange accent)
4. Create the variables as defined in `figma-variables-spec.json`
5. Create the Orchestra-Typography collection with the specified font variables

### 3. Adapting Core Components

Once variables are set up:

1. Navigate to the "_Core Components [Adapted]" page
2. Copy the base components from Frames X Web theme
3. Modify them according to the `component-adaptation-mapping.json` specification
4. Create necessary variants (size, state, etc.)

### 4. Creating Dashboard Design

After components are ready:

1. Navigate to the "Web - Dashboard" page
2. Use Figma's "First Draft" feature with the prompt from `figma-first-draft-prompt.txt`
3. Replace generic elements with your adapted components
4. Refine with Auto Layout and adjust to match the Orchestra design system

## Next Steps

1. **Component Adaptation**:
   - Complete adaptation of all required components
   - Ensure they work with the variable system for theming

2. **Additional Screens**:
   - Create designs for other screens (Agents, Personas, etc.)
   - Maintain consistency across all pages

3. **Design System Documentation**:
   - Document usage guidelines for components
   - Create pattern library for common UI patterns

4. **Prototyping**:
   - Create interactive prototypes for key user flows
   - Test the usability and get feedback

The foundation is now set for you to build a comprehensive design system and UI implementation in Figma.
