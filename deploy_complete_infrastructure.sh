## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Vercel Deployment Fix ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Fixed vercel.json configuration
- [x] Updated to use web/dist build directory
- [x] Added FastAPI backend integration
- [x] Deployed React admin interface

### Phase 2: MCP Servers Deployment 🔄 READY
- [ ] Deploy to Lambda Labs production instance
- [ ] Install K3s + Docker
- [ ] Deploy PostgreSQL + Redis
- [ ] Deploy MCP Memory (GPU-accelerated)
- [ ] Deploy MCP Tools + Orchestra API

### Phase 3: GPU Acceleration 🔄 READY
- [ ] Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- [ ] Configure GPU support for containers
- [ ] Enable CUDA acceleration for MCP Memory
- [ ] Test GPU utilization

### Phase 4: Advanced Monitoring 🔄 READY
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Deploy Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Configure Orchestra AI specific metrics
- [ ] Setup alerting rules

### Phase 5: Infrastructure Scaling 🔄 READY
- [ ] Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- [ ] Deploy NGINX Ingress Controller
- [ ] Setup Redis Cluster
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL read replicas
- [ ] Optimize performance settings

## 🎯 Deployment Commands

```bash
# Execute in order:
./deploy_lambda_mcp.sh          # Deploy MCP servers
./configure_gpu.sh              # Enable GPU acceleration
./setup_advanced_monitoring.sh  # Setup monitoring
./scale_infrastructure.sh       # Configure scaling
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Service Endpoints
- Frontend: https://orchestra-ai-admin.vercel.app
- API Server: http://150.136.94.139:8000
- MCP Memory: http://150.136.94.139:8003
- MCP Tools: http://150.136.94.139:8006
- Grafana: http://150.136.94.139:3000

### Performance Targets
- API Response Time: < 200ms
- GPU Utilization: > 80% during AI workloads
- Auto-scaling: 2-10 API replicas based on load
- Uptime: 99.9% availability

### Cost Optimization
- Production: $248/day (8x A100)
- Development: $18/day (1x A10)
- Auto-scaling reduces costs during low usage
