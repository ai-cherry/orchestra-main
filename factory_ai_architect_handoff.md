# Architect Mode Handoff: Factory AI Droid Integration

## Context Summary
The conductor has completed Phase 1 of the Factory AI Droid integration workflow. This handoff contains all necessary information for the Architect mode to design the detailed system architecture.

## Completed Work
1. ✓ Analyzed current project structure
2. ✓ Created integration workflow plan
3. ✓ Developed high-level integration strategy
4. ✓ Identified key integration points

## Architect Mode Tasks

### Primary Objective
Design a detailed system architecture that integrates Factory AI Droids with our existing cherry_ai project while maintaining full compatibility with Roo coder.

### Specific Deliverables Required

#### 1. System Architecture Diagram
Create a comprehensive architecture diagram showing:
- Factory AI Droid integration points
- MCP server connections
- Data flow between Roo and Factory systems
- Shared resource management (PostgreSQL, Weaviate, Lambda)

#### 2. Factory Bridge Integration Design
Detail the technical implementation of:
- Factory Bridge CLI integration
- Authentication and security flow
- API gateway design for Factory-MCP communication
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### 3. Droid-MCP Service Mapping
Define precise mappings:
```
Factory Droid → MCP Server → Capabilities
- Architect Droid → conductor Server → System design, Pulumi IaC
- Code Droid → Tools Server → Fast generation, optimization
- Debug Droid → Tools Server → Error diagnosis, query optimization
- Reliability Droid → Deployment Server → Incident management
- Knowledge Droid → Memory Server → Vector ops, documentation
```

#### 4. Enhanced Context Management Design
Architect the unified context system:
- Context synchronization protocol
- Vector store optimization for Factory AI
- State management across both systems
- Context versioning and rollback strategy

#### 5. Performance Optimization Architecture
Design for the 40% performance improvement target:
- Caching layers between systems
- Parallel execution patterns
- Resource pooling strategies
- Load balancing between Roo and Factory

### Technical Constraints
1. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing Roo functionality must remain intact
2. **Modular Design**: Components must be loosely coupled
3. **Resource Efficiency**: <10% overhead from integration
4. **Scalability**: Design must support future expansion

### Available Resources
1. **Current MCP Servers**:
   - conductor_server.py
   - memory_server.py
   - weaviate_direct_mcp_server.py
   - deployment_server.py
   - tools_server.py

2. **Existing Configuration**:
   - .mcp.json (MCP server definitions)
   - .roomodes (Roo mode configurations)
   - PostgreSQL + Weaviate infrastructure

3. **Factory AI Components** (to be integrated):
   - Factory Bridge CLI
   - Factory Context Manager
   - Factory Droid specifications

### Key Design Decisions Needed
1. **Integration Pattern**: Adapter vs. Direct Integration
2. **Context Storage**: Unified vs. Federated
3. **Routing Logic**: Static vs. Dynamic task assignment
4. **Monitoring**: Unified dashboard vs. Separate systems

### Success Criteria
1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Minimal latency between systems
3. Comprehensive error handling
4. Easy maintenance and debugging
5. Clear upgrade path

### Handoff Checklist
- [x] Integration plan document provided
- [x] Current system analysis complete
- [x] Factory AI requirements documented
- [x] Risk assessment included
- [x] Performance targets defined

### Next Steps After Architecture
Once the architecture is complete, the workflow will proceed to:
1. Code mode for implementation
2. Quality mode for validation
3. Documentation mode for final docs
