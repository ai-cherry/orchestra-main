# 🚀 CURSOR AI - LOCAL COLLABORATION SETUP

**IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Since production servers are having SSH/nginx issues, we're using a LOCAL collaboration bridge for instant live collaboration.**

## 🎯 **QUICK START (5 minutes):**

### **1. Pull Latest Changes:**
```bash
cd ~/orchestra-main-2
git pull origin main
```

### **2. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip3 install websockets asyncio
```

### **3. Start Local Collaboration Bridge:**
```bash
# In Terminal 1 - Start the bridge server
python3 local_collaboration_bridge.py

# You should see:
# 🚀 Starting Cherry AI Local Collaboration Bridge...
# 📡 Server: ws://localhost:8765
# ⏳ Waiting for Cursor AI and Manus to connect...
```

### **4. Connect Cursor AI:**
```bash
# In Terminal 2 - Run the Cursor client
python3 cursor_live_client.py

# You should see:
# ✅ Connected to local collaboration bridge
# 🤖 Ready for live collaboration with Manus
```

### **5. Test Live Collaboration:**
```bash
# In the Cursor client, try these commands:
send_command("ls -la")
send_command("git status")
edit_file("test_collaboration.txt", "Hello from Cursor AI!")
send_chat("Cursor AI is ready for collaboration!")
```

## 🔧 **AVAILABLE COMMANDS:**

### **File Operations:**
```python
# Edit files (Manus will see changes instantly)
edit_file("/path/to/file.py", "new content", "write")
edit_file("/path/to/file.py", "additional content", "append")
read_file("/path/to/file.py")
```

### **Shell Commands:**
```python
# Execute commands (results shared with Manus)
send_command("git status")
send_command("npm run build")
send_command("python3 test_script.py")
```

### **Communication:**
```python
# Chat with Manus in real-time
send_chat("Working on fixing the nginx configuration")
send_chat("Need help with database connection")
```

### **State Management:**
```python
# Update shared priorities
update_priorities([
    "Fix cherry-ai.me deployment",
    "Test enhanced interface",
    "Deploy to production"
])
```

## 🎯 **CURRENT PRIORITIES:**

1. **Fix SSH access** to production servers (45.32.69.157, 45.77.87.106)
2. **Deploy nginx configuration** and restart web services  
3. **Upload enhanced interface** to cherry-ai.me
4. **Test three AI personas** (Cherry, Sophia, Karen) working
5. **Establish production** live collaboration bridge

## 🚨 **PRODUCTION SERVER STATUS:**

- **Web Server (45.32.69.157)**: SSH timeout, nginx down
- **Database Server (45.77.87.106)**: SSH timeout
- **cherry-ai.me**: Not responding (basic landing page)

## 🔄 **WORKFLOW:**

### **Cursor AI Focus:**
- Frontend development and UI fixes
- Enhanced interface improvements
- Testing and debugging
- Local development and builds

### **Manus Focus:**
- Infrastructure and server management
- Production deployment and fixes
- API integration and backend
- Database operations

### **Shared Tasks:**
- Real-time file editing
- Command execution and results
- Progress updates and coordination
- Problem-solving and debugging

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE GOALS:**

### **Phase 1: Local Collaboration (NOW)**
- ✅ Start local bridge server
- ✅ Connect Cursor AI client
- ✅ Test real-time file editing
- ✅ Verify command execution

### **Phase 2: Production Fixes (NEXT)**
- 🔧 Fix SSH access to servers
- 🔧 Restart nginx and web services
- 🔧 Deploy enhanced interface
- 🔧 Test cherry-ai.me functionality

### **Phase 3: Live Production (FINAL)**
- 🚀 Move collaboration bridge to production
- 🚀 Enable direct server editing
- 🚀 Full live development environment
- 🚀 Cherry AI application fully working

## 💡 **BENEFITS:**

- **⚡ Instant sync**: Changes appear immediately for both AIs
- **🔄 Live handoffs**: Seamless task transitions
- **📊 Shared context**: Both AIs always know current state
- **🎯 Focused work**: Clear division of responsibilities
- **🚀 Fast iteration**: No GitHub commit/pull delays

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **Bridge Won't Start:**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :8765
# Kill existing process if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

### **Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Test WebSocket connection
curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Key: test" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" http://localhost:8765/
```

### **Python Dependencies:**
```bash
# Install missing packages
pip3 install websockets asyncio json subprocess
```

## 🎉 **SUCCESS INDICATORS:**

- ✅ Bridge server running on localhost:8765
- ✅ Cursor AI client connected and authenticated
- ✅ Real-time file editing working
- ✅ Command execution and results shared
- ✅ Chat communication active
- ✅ Shared priorities synchronized

**Once local collaboration is working, we'll fix the production servers and move to live production environment!** 🚀
