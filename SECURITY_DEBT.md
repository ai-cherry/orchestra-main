# Security Debt Documentation

This document outlines security considerations that have been deferred in favor of performance and development speed. These items should be addressed as the project scales.

## Authentication & Authorization

1. **High-Privilege Service Account**: The current implementation uses a single high-privilege service account

   - **Current approach**: Using a master service account with broad permissions
   - **Future improvement**: Implement least-privilege service accounts for each component
   - **Future improvement**: Add proper IAM role bindings with minimal permissions

2. **Direct Key Usage**: Service account keys are used directly

   - **Current approach**: Using GCP_MASTER_SERVICE_JSON environment variable directly
   - **Future improvement**: Implement Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions
   - **Future improvement**: Use Workload Identity for GCP service-to-service authentication

3. **Simplified Authentication**: Authentication is simplified for development speed
   - **Current approach**: Direct authentication with service account key
   - **Future improvement**: Implement proper authentication flow with token validation
   - **Future improvement**: Add user authentication and authorization

## Infrastructure Security

1. **Public Access**: Resources are publicly accessible for ease of development

   - **Current approach**: Cloud Run services are publicly accessible
   - **Future improvement**: Implement VPC Service Controls
   - **Future improvement**: Use private IP for database and Redis

2. **Simplified Network**: Network security is minimal

   - **Current approach**: Default network configuration
   - **Future improvement**: Implement proper network segmentation
   - **Future improvement**: Add firewall rules and security groups

3. **Deletion Protection**: Deletion protection is disabled for development flexibility
   - **Current approach**: Deletion protection disabled for easier development
   - **Future improvement**: Enable deletion protection for production resources
   - **Future improvement**: Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

## Application Security

1. **Input Validation**: Minimal input validation for development speed

   - **Current approach**: Basic validation through FastAPI
   - **Future improvement**: Implement comprehensive input validation
   - **Future improvement**: Add request rate limiting and abuse prevention

2. **Secrets Management**: Simplified secrets management

   - **Current approach**: Using Secret Manager but with simplified access
   - **Future improvement**: Implement proper secret rotation
   - **Future improvement**: Use Secret Manager for all sensitive information

3. **Logging & Monitoring**: Basic logging and monitoring
   - **Current approach**: Simple logging and performance metrics
   - **Future improvement**: Implement comprehensive security logging
   - **Future improvement**: Add security monitoring and alerting

## Remediation Timeline

These security items should be addressed according to the following timeline:

1. **Short-term (1-3 months)**:

   - Implement basic input validation
   - Improve secrets management
   - Add basic security logging

2. **Medium-term (3-6 months)**:

   - Implement least-privilege service accounts
   - Add proper network security
   - Implement user authentication

3. **Long-term (6+ months)**:
   - Implement Workload Identity Federation
   - Add VPC Service Controls
   - Implement comprehensive security monitoring

## Risk Assessment

| Risk                                 | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unauthorized access to GCP resources | Medium     | High   | Restrict IP access to GCP console, rotate service account keys regularly |
| Data exposure                        | Low        | High   | Ensure proper access controls to databases, encrypt sensitive data       |
| Service disruption                   | Low        | Medium | Implement monitoring and alerting, have rollback procedures              |
| Credential leakage                   | Medium     | High   | Store credentials securely, use Secret Manager, limit access             |

## Conclusion

This security debt has been intentionally incurred to prioritize development speed and performance for a single-developer project. As the project grows, these security considerations should be systematically addressed according to the timeline above.

The current implementation is suitable for development and early testing but should be hardened before handling sensitive data or being exposed to a wider audience.
