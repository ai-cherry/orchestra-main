## ðŸš¨ URGENT: Cherry AI Orchestrator Deployment Issues - Need Root Cause Analysis & Fix

### CONTEXT:
I've been trying to deploy the Cherry AI Orchestrator interface but keep hitting the same problems repeatedly. The UI shows mock data instead of connecting to the real backend, and deployment to the actual domain (cherry-ai.me) keeps failing.

### CURRENT SITUATION:

**1. Infrastructure:**
- Lambda Labs server: 150.136.94.139 (8x A100 GPU instance)
- Domain: cherry-ai.me (should be pointing to the server)
- Services running: PostgreSQL, Redis, Weaviate, Nginx
- API is working at: http://150.136.94.139:8000/api/health

**2. Key Files:**
- `cherry-ai-orchestrator-final.html` - The main UI (uses glass morphism design)
- `cherry-ai-orchestrator.js` - Original JavaScript (has mock data/alerts)
- `cherry-ai-orchestrator-enhanced.js` - Enhanced version (should connect to real API)
- `admin-interface/working-interface.html` - Simpler version someone created
- `deploy_orchestra_lambda.py` - Python deployment script
- `deploy_working_interface.sh` - Shell script for deploying to cherry-ai.me

**3. The Problems:**
a) **JavaScript Not Loading**: Despite updating the HTML to use `cherry-ai-orchestrator-enhanced.js`, the deployed site still uses the old mock data version
b) **Domain Deployment Fails**: Can't deploy to cherry-ai.me - SSH connection issues
c) **File Caching**: Changes don't seem to take effect even after deployment
d) **API Integration**: The UI isn't connecting to the real backend at 150.136.94.139:8000

### WHAT I'VE TRIED:
1. Created enhanced JavaScript file with real API endpoints
2. Updated HTML to reference the new JS file
3. Deployed via rsync to Lambda Labs
4. Configured nginx to serve files and proxy API requests
5. Created systemd service for the API
6. Tried multiple deployment scripts

### SPECIFIC ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE:

1. **Why isn't the enhanced JavaScript loading?**
   - Check if nginx is caching old files
   - Verify the HTML is actually updated on the server
   - Look for browser caching issues
   - Check file permissions

2. **Why can't we deploy to cherry-ai.me?**
   - DNS configuration issues?
   - SSH key problems?
   - Server not configured at that domain?
   - Firewall blocking connections?

3. **Root cause of mock data persisting:**
   - Is the old JS file cached somewhere?
   - Is the HTML not actually being updated?
   - Are we deploying to the wrong location?
   - Is nginx serving from a different directory?

### WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO:

1. **Diagnose the root cause** - Don't just try more deployments, figure out WHY it's not working
2. **Check the actual files on the server** - SSH in and verify what's really there
3. **Test the deployment chain** - Trace each step to find where it breaks
4. **Fix the cherry-ai.me deployment** - Figure out why SSH fails and fix it
5. **Ensure the real API connects** - The backend is working, make the frontend use it

### CRITICAL COMMANDS TO RUN:
```bash
# Check what's actually deployed
ssh ubuntu@150.136.94.139 "ls -la /opt/orchestra/"
ssh ubuntu@150.136.94.139 "head -20 /opt/orchestra/cherry-ai-orchestrator-final.html"
ssh ubuntu@150.136.94.139 "grep -n 'cherry-ai-orchestrator' /opt/orchestra/cherry-ai-orchestrator-final.html"

# Check nginx configuration
ssh ubuntu@150.136.94.139 "cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/orchestra"
ssh ubuntu@150.136.94.139 "sudo nginx -t"

# Check if API is accessible
curl -s http://150.136.94.139/api/health | jq '.'

# Test cherry-ai.me connection
ssh -v root@cherry-ai.me "echo 'Connection test'"
nslookup cherry-ai.me
```

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
1. The orchestrator UI at http://150.136.94.139/orchestrator/ shows REAL data, not mock data
2. All tabs work with actual API calls to the backend
3. Can deploy updates to cherry-ai.me successfully
4. Changes take effect immediately without caching issues

**Please focus on ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS first before attempting fixes. We need to understand WHY this keeps happening, not just apply more band-aids.**
