      PostgreSQL, Weaviate, and Pulumi on Vultr. Designs for single-dev,
      AI-assisted workflows.
    customInstructions: Always design for hot-swappable modules and clear
      interfaces. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for Postgres query optimization. Index all
      code and docs in Weaviate for rapid retrieval. Pulumi stacks must target
      Vultr and be modular. Context sharing via MCP is required for all
      architecture diagrams and planning.
