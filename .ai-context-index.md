# AI Context Index

This file serves as an index of all context files provided for AI coding assistants. These files contain detailed information about the project architecture, components, and design patterns to help tools like GitHub Copilot better understand the codebase.

## Primary Context Files

- [**AI_CONTEXT.md**](/workspaces/orchestra-main/AI_CONTEXT.md) - Main system overview with architecture and key components
- [**Memory System**](/workspaces/orchestra-main/packages/shared/src/memory/MEMORY_CONTEXT.md) - Memory system architecture and implementation details
- [**LLM Provider System**](/workspaces/orchestra-main/core/orchestrator/src/services/llm/LLM_PROVIDER_CONTEXT.md) - LLM provider abstraction and fallback mechanisms

## Project Structure

AI Orchestra follows a modular architecture:

- `/core/orchestrator/` - Core service implementation and API endpoints
- `/packages/` - Shared libraries and modular components
  - `/packages/shared/` - Common utilities and models
  - `/packages/agents/` - Agent implementations
  - `/packages/personas/` - Persona definitions and templates
- `/tests/` - Test suite covering all components
- `/infra/` - Infrastructure as code for deployment
- `/future/` - Upcoming features in development

## Key Components

1. **Memory System**: Stores conversation history and context for AI agents
2. **Persona System**: Manages different AI personalities and response styles
3. **LLM Providers**: Abstracts different language model providers with fallback capability
4. **Agent Orchestration**: Coordinates specialized AI agents for different tasks
5. **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints for client applications

## Development Patterns

The codebase follows these key patterns:

1. **Registry Pattern**: For service and component registration
2. **Dependency Injection**: For service provision and testability
3. **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
4. **Factory Pattern**: For dynamic component creation
5. **Strategy Pattern**: For swappable implementations

## Models and Data Flow

Key data models:
- `MemoryItem`: Core storage unit for conversation history
- `PersonaConfig`: Defines persona traits and behavior
- `AgentData`: Contains agent state information

Data typically flows through the system as:
User Request → API Endpoint → Orchestrator → Agents → LLM Provider → Response

## File Naming Conventions

- `stubs.py`: Contains stub implementations for development and testing
- `*_manager.py`: Component managers that handle lifecycle and coordination
- `exceptions.py`: Dedicated exception classes for a component
- `*_registry.py`: Registry implementations for component management

## Future Development

Areas marked for future development:
- Enhanced persistence with Firestore integration
- More sophisticated agent coordination
- Expanded persona capabilities
