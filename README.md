# 🚀 Live Collaboration Test Project

## 🎯 Purpose
This project demonstrates **real-time collaboration** between Cursor IDE and Manus AI!

## ✨ What Makes This Special
- **No Git commits needed** - Manus sees changes instantly
- **Real-time synchronization** - Changes appear in < 1 second
- **Multi-language support** - Python, JavaScript, HTML, Markdown

## 📁 Test Files
