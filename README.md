# Orchestra AI

**Orchestra AI** is a modular, cloud-native platform for AI-driven data enrichment, workflow automation, and multi-agent orchestration.
It is designed for performance, stability, and extensibility, leveraging Docker Compose, Poetry, and GCP as first-class citizens.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# One-time setup (Python 3.10+, Docker Compose v2, Poetry)
docker compose build
./start.sh up

# Daily use
./start.sh shell
```

Everything else is handled by Docker and Poetry.
See [README_NO_BS.md](README_NO_BS.md) for a minimal workflow, or [UNFUCK_EVERYTHING.md](UNFUCK_EVERYTHING.md) for a full setup guide.
