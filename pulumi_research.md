# Pulumi IaC Best Practices Research

## Key Findings from Pulumi Official Documentation

### Core Best Practices Summary:

1. **Keep it as simple as possible, but no simpler** - Use single project when possible, multiple projects only when necessary
2. **Use stacks freely** - Multiple stacks don't add complexity like multiple projects do
3. **Focus on requirements** - Don't get distracted by cool features, focus on repeatable, reliable deployments
4. **Security first** - Use Pulumi CrossGuard for policy as code, implement RBAC

### Pulumi Project Evolution Pattern:
- Start: Single project, two stacks (prod/test)
- Growth: Add per-developer stacks for productivity
- Scale: Split into multiple projects (base infrastructure, platform, applications)
- Mature: Add stack references, RBAC, Automation API

### Advanced Features for Consideration:
- **Pulumi ESC**: Secrets and configuration management
- **Pulumi Deployments**: GitOps workflows, Review Stacks, OIDC support
- **Component Resources**: Reusable infrastructure patterns
- **Automation API**: Higher-level orchestration
- **CrossGuard**: Policy as code for compliance

### Project Structure Recommendations:
- Base Infrastructure Project
- Platform/Kubernetes Project  
- Application Projects (can be split by service)
- Data Layer Project (if needed)

# Docker CI/CD Best Practices Research

## Key Findings from Octopus Deploy

### Expert Tips for Docker CI/CD:

1. **Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size**
   - Separate dependencies needed for building from final runtime environment
   - Reduces final image size for faster deployments and reduced storage costs

2. **Optimize caching for faster builds**
   - Structure Dockerfiles so infrequent changes (base images, dependencies) come first
   - More frequent changes (code, configurations) later in file
   - Maximizes cache reuse

3. **Parallelize Dockerized tests in CI pipelines**
   - Use CI tools that support parallel job execution
   - Run multiple test suites simultaneously in isolated Docker containers
   - Reduces overall test execution time

4. **Enable Docker layer sharing in CI/CD runners**
   - Configure shared runners to persist Docker layers between builds
   - Significantly reduces build times by caching layers
   - Particularly effective in GitLab CI or Jenkins

5. **Enforce security scanning for Docker images**
   - Integrate security scanning tools like Trivy or Clair
   - Ensure every image passes security scans before production deployment

### Docker CI/CD Benefits:
- **Consistent Environment**: Eliminates "it works on my machine" problem
- **Quick Creation/Teardown**: Advantageous for CI/CD workflows
- **Isolated Testing**: Automated tests in isolated containers
- **Faster Release Cycles**: Improved software quality through consistency

### Containerization Best Practices:
- **One Application Per Container**: Decouple applications for easier scaling
- **Stateless and Immutable**: Containers should be stateless and immutable
- **Optimize for Build Cache**: Structure builds to maximize cache efficiency

# GitHub Actions CI/CD Best Practices Research

## Key Findings from Medium Guide

### Three Essential Optimization Techniques:

1. **Parallel Jobs**
   - Run multiple tasks simultaneously to reduce overall build times
   - Better resource utilization and enhanced efficiency
   - Define multiple jobs within the `jobs` section of YAML file
   - Ensure each job runs independently without conflicting dependencies

2. **Caching Dependencies**
   - Reuse previously fetched dependencies to speed up pipelines
   - Use `actions/cache` action to cache dependencies
   - Benefits: Reduced build times, lower bandwidth usage, consistent environments
   - Use effective cache keys to maximize hit rates

3. **Matrix Builds**
   - Test code across multiple environments for comprehensive testing
   - Run tests across various configurations (OS, language versions)
   - Example: 3 OS × 3 Python versions = 9 combinations
   - Ensures compatibility and stability across platforms

### Best Practices Summary:
- **Optimal Job Distribution**: Distribute tasks effectively across parallel jobs
- **Resource Management**: Optimize resource usage for parallel execution
- **Cache Size Management**: Manage cache size efficiently
- **Matrix Configuration**: Define efficient matrix of environments
- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Monitor execution and troubleshoot issues

# Lambda Labs GPU Cloud Best Practices Research

## Key Findings from Community Forum

### Deployment Automation with Ansible:
- Use Ansible playbooks for automated server setup
- Clone repositories directly to Lambda instances
- Install dependencies (apt packages, pip packages)
- Start Docker containers for consistent environments

### Common Setup Pattern:
```yaml
- hosts: all
  remote_user: ubuntu
  vars:
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: "~/.ssh/your-private-ssh-key"
    github_username: username
    github_token: token
    github_repo: repo_name
  tasks:
    - name: Checkout Code From Github
      git:
        repo: "https://{{ github_token }}@github.com/{{ github_username }}/{{ github_repo }}.git"
        dest: "~/{{ github_repo }}"
    - name: Install packages
    - name: Start Docker container
```

### Best Practices for Lambda Labs:
- Use shell scripts for instance setup automation
- Clone projects from GitHub for current task datasets
- Use Docker for consistent environments
- Leverage PyCharm SSH plugin and conda for development
- Push code updates and server setup files regularly

# Vercel Deployment Best Practices Research

## Key Findings from Community Forum

### Production/Pre-Production Workflow:
- **Branch Strategy**: Use separate branches for different environments
  - `main` → Production deployment
  - `pre-production` or `staging` → Preview deployment
- **Git Integration**: 
  - Git pushes to pre-production trigger Preview deployment
  - Git pushes to main go to Production
- **Custom Subdomains**: Use custom subdomains like `staging.myapp.com` for Pre-Production

### Environment Management:
- Configure separate environments in Vercel dashboard
- Use environment-specific variables
- Implement deployment protection for staging environments
- Use Preview deployments for testing before production

### Common Patterns:
- Two-branch strategy: `main` and `stage`
- Merge changes into `stage` first for testing
- Merge to `main` when ready for production
- Use Vercel's automatic deployment triggers
