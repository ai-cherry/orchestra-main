# Systematic Debugging Standards for Orchestra AI

## Debugging Methodology

### Error Reproduction (Step 1)
- Create minimal test cases that reproduce the error consistently
- Document exact steps, inputs, and environment conditions
- Identify patterns in error occurrence (timing, load, specific inputs)
- Capture complete error context including logs, stack traces, and state

### Isolation and Analysis (Step 2) 
- Use binary search methodology to isolate error location
- Add strategic logging points to track execution flow
- Test individual components in isolation
- Verify assumptions about data flow and state changes

### Root Cause Identification (Step 3)
- Trace error backwards from symptom to original cause
- Distinguish between symptoms and actual root causes
- Consider race conditions, resource constraints, and edge cases
- Document all findings and hypotheses

### Solution Implementation (Step 4)
- Design targeted fixes that address root causes, not just symptoms
- Implement comprehensive testing for the fix
- Consider impact on other system components
- Plan rollback procedures if fix causes new issues

## Orchestra AI Specific Debugging

### MCP Server Debugging
- Monitor server health endpoints and response times
- Check server logs for connection issues and timeouts
- Verify API key configuration and permissions
- Test server isolation to identify network issues

### AI Agent Coordination Issues
- Debug context sharing between agents
- Monitor task handoffs and dependency resolution
- Check for race conditions in parallel execution
- Verify error propagation between agents

### Performance Debugging
- Profile code execution with appropriate tools
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network)
- Identify bottlenecks in workflow execution
- Analyze database query performance

### Integration Debugging
- Test API endpoints with curl/postman
- Verify database connections and queries
- Check configuration consistency across environments
- Monitor third-party service dependencies
