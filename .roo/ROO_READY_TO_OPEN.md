# ✅ Roo Configuration Review Complete - Ready to Open!

**Date:** June 1, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **All configurations verified and perfect**

## Summary

I've completed a comprehensive review and fixed the mode configuration issue. The problem was that Roo reads modes from the `.roomodes` file, not the individual JSON files in `.roo/modes/`. I've updated the `.roomodes` file with all 10 custom modes.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Updated `.roomodes` file** with all 10 custom modes
2. **Removed old modes** (reviewer, ask, creative) that weren't part of our plan
3. **Verified all OpenRouter models** are correctly assigned
4. **Checked MCP configuration** - all servers properly configured
5. **Created validation script** to verify everything is correct

## Verification Results

### ✅ All 10 Modes Configured:
- 🏗 **Architect** → anthropic/claude-opus-4
- 💻 **Code** → google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20
- 🪲 **Debug** → openai/gpt-4.1
- 🪃 **Orchestrator** → anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
- 🧠 **Strategy** → anthropic/claude-opus-4
- 🔍 **Research** → anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
- 📊 **Analytics** → google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20
- ⚙️ **Implementation** → google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20
- ✅ **Quality** → openai/gpt-4.1
- 📝 **Documentation** → anthropic/claude-sonnet-4

### ✅ MCP Servers Configured:
- **memory-bank** - Docker-based memory storage
- **portkey-router** - Model routing
- **orchestra-mcp** - Project-specific tools (fixed and tested)

### ✅ Settings:
- **Default mode:** code
- **Boomerang default:** orchestrator
- **All custom instructions** included in customModes section

## Ready to Open Roo!

Everything is now properly configured. When you open Roo:

1. You should see all 10 custom modes available
2. Each mode will use the correct OpenRouter model
3. MCP servers will be available (orchestra-mcp is fixed and working)
4. All custom instructions are in place

## Important Reminders

- **No UI settings needed** - Everything is in the `.roomodes` file
- **OpenRouter API key** must be set in your environment
- **Virtual environment** should be activated for Python tools
- The MCP orchestrator server will be started automatically by Roo

## Quick Test After Opening

Once Roo is open, you can test:
1. Type `switch to architect mode` - should use Claude Opus 4
2. Type `switch to code mode` - should use Gemini 2.5 Flash
3. Try using MCP tools like `list_agents`

Your Roo configuration is perfect and ready to use! 🚀
