# System Architecture Standards for Orchestra AI

## Design Principles

### Scalability First
- Design for horizontal scaling from day one
- Use microservices architecture where appropriate
- Implement stateless services with external state storage
- Consider load balancing and auto-scaling requirements

### Database Architecture
- PostgreSQL for transactional data with proper indexing
- Weaviate for vector storage and semantic search
- Redis for caching and session management
- Design proper data models with normalized schemas

### Infrastructure as Code
- Use Pulumi for all infrastructure definitions
- Version control all infrastructure changes
- Implement proper environment separation (dev/staging/prod)
- Automate deployment and rollback procedures

### Security Architecture
- Implement zero-trust security models
- Use proper authentication and authorization patterns
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Orchestra AI Specific Patterns

### MCP Server Architecture
- Design MCP servers for specific domains
- Implement proper API versioning
- Use async patterns for all I/O operations
- Include comprehensive health checks and monitoring

### AI Agent Coordination
- Design clear interfaces between AI agents
- Implement proper context sharing mechanisms
- Use message queues for async agent communication
- Design fallback strategies for agent failures

### Performance Requirements
- Sub-2-second API response times
- 99.9% uptime SLA targets
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Efficient resource utilization

### Cost Optimization
- Use spot instances where appropriate
- Implement proper resource tagging and monitoring
- Design for cost-effective scaling patterns
- Regular cost analysis and optimization reviews
