# Workflow Orchestration Standards for Orchestra AI

## Task Decomposition Methodology

### Atomic Task Design
- Break complex tasks into indivisible, testable units
- Each subtask must have clear inputs, outputs, and success criteria
- Define explicit dependencies between tasks
- Ensure each task can be executed independently when dependencies are met

### Dependency Graph Creation
- Create visual dependency graphs for complex workflows
- Identify critical path for time optimization
- Highlight tasks that can be executed in parallel
- Plan for dependency failures and alternative paths

### Context Management
- Use MCP servers for persistent state management
- Implement checkpointing for long-running workflows
- Design context sharing between agents and tools
- Maintain audit trails for all workflow decisions

## Boomerang Task Patterns

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- Route different tasks to appropriate AI agents based on expertise
- Coordinate between Cursor, Roo, and Continue.dev tools
- Implement handoff protocols between agents
- Design feedback loops for quality improvement

### Error Recovery Strategies
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Design graceful degradation for partial failures
- Create rollback procedures for critical operations
- Maintain error context for debugging and learning

### Performance Optimization
- Identify bottlenecks in workflow execution
- Optimize for parallel execution where possible
- Implement resource pooling for repeated operations
- Monitor and optimize execution times

## Orchestra AI Specific Workflows

### Development Workflow Patterns
- Code generation → Review → Testing → Integration
- Research → Design → Implementation → Validation
- Problem identification → Analysis → Solution → Verification

### Multi-Tool Integration
- Coordinate between different coding assistants
- Share context via MCP servers
- Optimize tool selection based on task characteristics
- Implement fallback strategies for tool failures

### Quality Assurance Integration
- Automatic testing at each workflow stage
- Code review integration in development workflows
- Performance monitoring throughout execution
- Security validation for all code changes
