# Workflow coordination for conductor Mode

## Task Decomposition
- Break complex tasks into atomic units
- Define clear inputs and outputs for each step
- Create dependency graphs for parallel execution
- Use MCP context for state management
- Implement checkpointing for long workflows

## Agent Coordination
- Define clear agent roles and responsibilities
- Use message passing for inter-agent communication
- Implement agent health monitoring
- Handle agent failures gracefully
- Load balance work across available agents

## Context Management
- Maintain workflow context in MCP
- Share relevant context between agents
- Implement context pruning for efficiency
- Version context for rollback capability
- Use vector store for context retrieval

## Execution Patterns
- Implement saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Use circuit breakers for external services
- Handle partial failures gracefully
- Implement compensation logic
- Monitor workflow performance metrics

## Optimization Strategies
- Parallelize independent tasks
- Cache intermediate results
- Implement dynamic task prioritization
- Use predictive scaling for agents
- Optimize context transfer between steps
