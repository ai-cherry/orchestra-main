# Roo Setup Complete for cherry_ai Project

✅ **Setup Status**: All components successfully configured

## What Was Created

### 1. Mode Configuration Files (10 modes)
Location: `.roo/modes/`
- ✅ architect.json (Claude Opus 4)
- ✅ code.json (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- ✅ debug.json (GPT-4.1)
- ✅ conductor.json (Claude Sonnet 4)
- ✅ strategy.json (Claude Opus 4)
- ✅ research.json (Claude Sonnet 4)
- ✅ analytics.json (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- ✅ implementation.json (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- ✅ quality.json (GPT-4.1)
- ✅ documentation.json (Claude Sonnet 4)

### 2. Rules Directories
Location: `.roo/rules-{mode}/`
Each mode has its own rules directory with at least one markdown file containing mode-specific guidelines.

### 3. MCP Configuration
Location: `.roo/mcp.json`
Configured with:
- memory-bank (Docker-based memory storage)
- portkey-router (Model routing)
- conductor-mcp (Project-specific tools)

### 4. Verification Script
Location: `.roo/scripts/verify_setup.py`
Run with: `python3 .roo/scripts/verify_setup.py`

## Next Steps

1. **Close Roo** (if currently running)
2. **Start MCP servers**:
   ```bash
   # Start the cherry_ai MCP server
   python mcp_server/servers/cherry_ai_server.py
   ```
3. **Reopen Roo**
4. **Test mode switching**:
   - Type: `switch to architect mode`
   - Try other modes: `switch to code mode`, etc.

## Important Configuration Notes

- All modes use **OpenRouter API only**
- No UI settings should be changed - JSON files are source of truth
- Each mode has specific file permissions and tool access
- MCP integration provides context, vector, db, deploy, and monitor tools

## Troubleshooting

If Roo doesn't recognize the modes:

2. Check that OpenRouter API key is set in environment
3. Verify MCP servers are accessible
4. Run the verification script to check setup
5. Check Roo logs for any error messages
