# Quality Assurance Standards for Orchestra AI

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Requirements
- Achieve >90% code coverage for all new code
- Test all public methods and functions
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Use pytest fixtures for consistent test data
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Integration Testing
- Test API endpoints with real database connections
- Verify MCP server integrations work correctly
- Test cross-service communication patterns
- Include performance testing for critical paths

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify AI agent coordination works properly
- Test error recovery and fallback mechanisms
- Include stress testing under load

### Test Organization
- Organize tests by feature/module
- Use descriptive test names that explain purpose
- Include setup and teardown for test isolation
- Maintain test documentation and examples

## Code Review Standards

### Review Checklist
