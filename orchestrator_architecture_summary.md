- Implement voice recording and synthesis
- Create file upload/download system
- Add real-time suggestions

### Phase 3: Real-time & Polish (Days 8-10)
- Connect WebSocket events
- Implement virtual scrolling
- Add loading states and error handling
- Optimize bundle size

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Days 11-14)
- Unit and integration tests
- Accessibility audit
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment

## API Architecture

### REST Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/orchestrator/search` - Perform searches
- `GET /api/v1/orchestrator/suggestions` - Get search suggestions
- `POST /api/v1/orchestrator/voice/transcribe` - Convert speech to text
- `POST /api/v1/orchestrator/voice/synthesize` - Convert text to speech
- `POST /api/v1/orchestrator/files/upload` - Upload files
- `GET /api/v1/orchestrator/files/{fileId}` - Get file status

### WebSocket Events
- `search:progress` - Real-time search updates
- `voice:partial` - Streaming transcription
- `file:progress` - File upload/processing status
- `system:notification` - System-wide notifications

## State Management

### Zustand Store Structure
```typescript
interface OrchestratorState {
  search: {
    query: string;
    mode: SearchMode;
    inputMode: InputMode;
    suggestions: Suggestion[];
    results: SearchResult[];
    isSearching: boolean;
  };
  voice: {
    isRecording: boolean;
    transcription: string;
    selectedVoice: VoiceOption;
  };
  files: {
    uploads: FileUpload[];
    downloads: FileDownload[];
  };
  ui: {
    activePanel: PanelType;
    theme: 'dark' | 'light';
  };
}
```

## Component Architecture

### Core Components
1. **OrchestratorLandingPage** - Main container component
2. **SearchSection** - Search interface with mode selection
3. **VoiceSection** - Voice recording and synthesis
4. **FileManager** - File upload and download management
5. **SuggestionsPanel** - Real-time search suggestions

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting for voice and file sections
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Debounced search input
- Request deduplication
- Response caching with TTL
- Progressive image loading

## Security Measures
- Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- CSRF protection for mutations
- File upload validation
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Secure WebSocket authentication
- Content Security Policy headers

## Success Metrics
- 100% keyboard navigable
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- 95%+ test coverage
- Zero critical vulnerabilities
- Sub-100ms API response times
- <300KB JavaScript bundle

## Next Steps
