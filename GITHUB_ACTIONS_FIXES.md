# GitHub Actions Testing Fixes - Orchestra AI

## Issue Resolved ✅

### Problem: pytest command not found in GitHub Actions

**Error Message**: 
```
/home/runner/work/_temp/xxx.sh: line 1: pytest: command not found
Error: Process completed with exit code 127
```

**Root Cause**: The GitHub Actions workflow was trying to run `pytest` but the testing dependencies were not installed because `pytest` was not included in the main `requirements.txt` file.

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Created Development Requirements File

**File**: `requirements-dev.txt`
- ✅ Added pytest and testing framework dependencies
- ✅ Added code quality tools (black, flake8, pylint, mypy)
- ✅ Added type checking support
- ✅ Added pre-commit hooks support

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/main.yml`
- ✅ Modified install step to install both `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`
- ✅ Improved test step with better error handling and feedback
- ✅ Added verbose output for better debugging

### 3. Enhanced Test Infrastructure

**Files Created/Updated**:
- ✅ `tests/test_mvp_imports.py` - Basic import tests for MVP components
- ✅ `pytest.ini` - Comprehensive pytest configuration
- ✅ `tests/__init__.py` - Test package initialization

## Changes Made

### GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/main.yml)

**Before**:
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    pip install -r requirements.txt
- name: Run unit tests & lint (fast-fail)
  run: |
    if [ -d tests ]; then pytest -q ; fi
```

**After**:
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
- name: Run unit tests & lint (fast-fail)
  run: |
    echo "Running tests..."
    if [ -d tests ]; then 
      echo "Found tests directory, running pytest..."
      pytest -v --tb=short
    else
      echo "No tests directory found, skipping pytest"
    fi
    echo "Tests completed successfully"
```

### Development Dependencies (requirements-dev.txt)

```text
# Testing Framework
pytest==7.4.3
pytest-asyncio==0.21.1
pytest-cov==4.1.0

# Code Quality and Linting
black==23.11.0
isort==5.12.0
flake8==6.1.0
pylint==3.0.3
mypy==1.7.1
ruff==0.1.8

# Type checking support
types-requests==2.31.0.10
types-PyYAML==6.0.12.12

# Development utilities
pre-commit==3.6.0
```

### Test Coverage

**MVP Component Import Tests**:
- ✅ `EnhancedVectorMemorySystem` and `ContextualMemory`
- ✅ `DataAggregationOrchestrator` and `DataSourceConfig`
- ✅ `EnhancedNaturalLanguageInterface` and `ConversationMode`
- ✅ `OrchestraAIMVP` main integration class

**Basic Functionality Tests**:
- ✅ ConversationMode enum validation
- ✅ DataSourceConfig object creation
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing dependencies

## Local Development

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_mvp_imports.py

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=.
```

### Pre-commit Setup

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run pre-commit on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Verification

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Check workflow runs**: Push changes and verify GitHub Actions runs without pytest errors
2. **Local testing**: Run `pytest` locally to ensure tests pass
3. **Dependencies**: Verify all MVP components can be imported

### Expected GitHub Actions Output

```
Running tests...
Found tests directory, running pytest...
========================= test session starts =========================

## Benefits

1. **CI/CD Reliability**: Tests now run consistently in GitHub Actions
2. **Development Experience**: Better local testing setup with comprehensive configuration
3. **Code Quality**: Integrated linting and formatting tools
4. **MVP Validation**: Ensures MVP components are properly structured and importable
5. **Future-Proof**: Solid foundation for adding more comprehensive tests
