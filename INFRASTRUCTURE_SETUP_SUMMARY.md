# AI Orchestra GCP Infrastructure Setup Summary

## Overview

We've created a comprehensive infrastructure setup for the AI Orchestra project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This setup includes powerful service accounts for Vertex AI and Gemini with extensive permissions, Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions, and GitHub integration for CI/CD workflows.

## Components Created

### Documentation

1. **GCP_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Detailed step-by-step instructions for setting up the GCP infrastructure manually
2. **RUN_THIS_TO_SETUP_GCP.md** - Simple instructions for running the setup script
3. **INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP_SUMMARY.md** (this file) - High-level overview of the infrastructure setup

### Scripts

1. **setup_gcp_now.sh** - Executable script that sets up the entire GCP infrastructure in one go
2. **deploy_gcp_infra.sh** - Alternative script for deploying the infrastructure using Terraform

### Terraform Configuration

1. **terraform/vertex_gemini_setup.tf** - Terraform configuration for creating the service accounts and setting up Workload Identity Federation

### GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **.github/workflows/deploy-to-gcp.yml** - GitHub Actions workflow for deploying to Cloud Run using Workload Identity Federation

## Service Accounts

### Vertex AI Service Account

The Vertex AI service account (`vertex-ai-badass@cherry-ai-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) has the following roles:

- `roles/aiplatform.admin`
- `roles/aiplatform.user`
- `roles/storage.admin`
- `roles/logging.admin`

This service account can perform any operation with Vertex AI, including:
- Creating and managing datasets
- Training and deploying models
- Running predictions
- Managing endpoints
- Accessing logs

### Gemini Service Account

The Gemini service account (`gemini-badass@cherry-ai-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) has the following roles:

- `roles/aiplatform.user`
- `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer`

This service account can perform any operation with Gemini API, including:
- Generating text
- Creating multi-turn conversations
- Processing images
- Fine-tuning models

## Workload Identity Federation

Workload Identity Federation allows GitHub Actions workflows to authenticate with GCP without storing service account keys in GitHub secrets. The setup includes:

- A Workload Identity pool for GitHub Actions
- A provider for GitHub
- IAM bindings to allow GitHub Actions to impersonate the service accounts

## Secret Management

The service account keys are stored in:

1. **Secret Manager** - For secure access within GCP
   - `vertex-ai-key`
   - `gemini-key`

2. **GitHub Secrets** - For use in GitHub Actions workflows
   - `VERTEX_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
   - `GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
   - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
   - `GCP_REGION`
   - `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`
   - `VERTEX_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`
   - `GEMINI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow authenticates with GCP using Workload Identity Federation and deploys to Cloud Run. The workflow is triggered on pushes to the main branch and can also be triggered manually.

## How to Use

### Setting Up the Infrastructure

To set up the infrastructure, run:

```bash
chmod +x setup_gcp_now.sh && ./setup_gcp_now.sh
```

### Using the Service Accounts

#### Vertex AI Example

```python
import os
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.cloud import aiplatform

# Path to the service account key file
key_path = "vertex-ai-key.json"

# Create credentials
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    key_path,
    scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"]
)

# Initialize Vertex AI with the credentials
aiplatform.init(
    project="cherry-ai-project",
    location="us-central1",
    credentials=credentials
)

# Now you can use Vertex AI
endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint("projects/cherry-ai-project/locations/us-central1/endpoints/YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID")
prediction = endpoint.predict(instances=[{"feature1": 1.0, "feature2": "value"}])
print(prediction)
```

#### Gemini Example

```python
import google.generativeai as genai
from google.oauth2 import service_account

# Path to the service account key file
key_path = "gemini-key.json"

# Create credentials
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    key_path,
    scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"]
)

# Configure the Gemini API
genai.configure(
    api_key=None,  # Not needed when using service account
    credentials=credentials,
    project_id="cherry-ai-project",
)

# Generate text
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')
response = model.generate_content('Write a poem about artificial intelligence.')
print(response.text)
```

## Security Considerations

While this setup intentionally creates service accounts with extensive permissions for maximum flexibility, it's important to consider security implications:

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: In a production environment, consider granting only the permissions that are necessary for your specific use case.
2. **Key Management**: Service account keys are sensitive and should be stored securely. The setup stores them in Secret Manager and GitHub secrets.
3. **Access Control**: Limit access to the service account keys and GitHub secrets to only those who need them.

## Conclusion

This infrastructure setup provides a comprehensive solution for the AI Orchestra project on GCP. It includes powerful service accounts for Vertex AI and Gemini, Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions, and GitHub integration for CI/CD workflows. The setup is designed to give you maximum flexibility and power for your AI Orchestra project.
