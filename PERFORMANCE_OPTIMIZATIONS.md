# AI Orchestra Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented for the AI Orchestra project to ensure stability, scalability, and efficient resource usage in production environments.

## Infrastructure Optimizations

### Cloud Run Optimizations

- **CPU Allocation**: Increased CPU allocation to prevent throttling during high-load operations
- **Memory Allocation**: Optimized memory allocation based on application profiling
- **Concurrency Settings**: Tuned container concurrency for optimal throughput
- **Startup CPU Boost**: Enabled startup CPU boost for faster cold starts
- **Min/Max Instances**: Configured minimum instances to prevent cold starts
- **Execution Environment**: Using Cloud Run Gen2 execution environment
- **Health Checks**: Implemented startup and liveness probes for better stability
- **Keep-Warm Job**: Added Cloud Scheduler job to prevent cold starts

### Multi-Architecture Support

- **ARM64/AMD64 Support**: Added multi-architecture build support for better performance on different CPU architectures
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Optimized container builds for each platform

### Monitoring and Alerting

- **Performance Metrics**: Implemented comprehensive monitoring dashboard
- **Latency Alerts**: Set up alerts for high latency
- **Resource Utilization Alerts**: Configured alerts for high CPU and memory usage
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Added monitoring for error rates

## Deployment Pipeline Improvements

- **Manual Approval for Production**: Added manual approval step for production deployments
- **Multi-Stage Builds**: Optimized Docker builds with multi-stage approach
- **Build Caching**: Implemented efficient build caching
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Added dry-run capability to deployment scripts

## Security Enhancements

- **Workload Identity Federation**: Using WIF instead of service account keys
- **Secret Management**: Improved secret handling with Secret Manager
- **IAM Permissions**: Minimized IAM permissions to follow principle of least privilege

## Python Application Optimizations

- **Python Optimization Flags**: Using PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2 for maximum performance
- **Unbuffered I/O**: Enabled PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 for better logging
- **Dependency Management**: Optimized dependency management with Poetry
- **Async Patterns**: Leveraged async/await patterns for I/O-bound operations

## Usage

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy with default settings
./apply_performance_optimizations.sh

# Deploy with custom settings
./apply_performance_optimizations.sh --project your-project-id --region us-central1 --env prod

# Test deployment without making changes
./apply_performance_optimizations.sh --dry-run
```

### Configuration Options

- `--project`: GCP project ID
- `--region`: GCP region
- `--env`: Environment (dev, staging, prod)
- `--service-account`: Service account name
- `--dry-run`: Run in dry-run mode without making changes

## Terraform Configuration

The Terraform configuration has been modularized for better maintainability:

- `main.tf`: Provider configuration and API enablement
- `iam.tf`: IAM-related resources
- `cloud_run.tf`: Cloud Run service configuration
- `monitoring.tf`: Monitoring and alerting resources
- `outputs.tf`: Output values

## Monitoring Dashboard

The monitoring dashboard provides visibility into:

- Request latency (p95)
- CPU utilization
- Memory utilization
- Request count
- Error rates

## Future Optimizations

- Implement distributed tracing with Cloud Trace
- Add custom metrics for business-specific monitoring
- Implement auto-scaling based on custom metrics
- Explore Cloud Run VPC Connector for secure database access
