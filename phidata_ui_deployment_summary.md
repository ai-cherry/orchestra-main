# Phidata Agent UI Deployment and Testing Summary

This document summarizes the changes and resources created for Phase C (Deploy & Test Placeholder UI) of the project.

## 1. Terraform Configuration Updates

We've updated the Phidata Agent UI Cloud Run service configuration in `infra/orchestra-terraform/cloudrun.tf` with the following changes:

* Changed the image tag from `latest` to the specific version `1.0.0` for better stability and reproducibility
* Verified that the container port is correctly set to `8000`
* Confirmed that the environment variable `PHIDATA_API_URL` is correctly configured to point to the backend API service URI

These changes ensure that:
- The service uses a consistent, known version of the UI image
- The container port configuration matches the application's requirements
- The UI can properly connect to the backend API

## 2. Deployment Process

Since the development environment doesn't have Terraform or Docker installed directly, we've created a deployment script:

### `deploy_phidata_ui.sh`

This script:
- Creates a Docker container with Terraform installed
- Initializes Terraform in the correct directory
- Creates and selects the dev workspace
- Plans and applies the Terraform changes specifically targeting the Phidata Agent UI service
- Retrieves and displays the deployed service URL for testing

To deploy the updated UI service:

```bash
./deploy_phidata_ui.sh
```

## 3. Testing Guide

We've created a comprehensive testing guide (`phidata_ui_testing_guide.md`) that provides:

- Step-by-step instructions for accessing the deployed UI
- Detailed test scenarios for verifying functionality:
  - Basic connectivity
  - Agent selection
  - Chat interactions
  - Tool integrations (DuckDuckGo, Calculator, Wikipedia)
  - Multiple tool interactions
  - Session persistence
- Troubleshooting tips for common issues
- Guidelines for reporting bugs
- Recommendations for next steps

## 4. Next Steps

1. Run the deployment script to apply the Terraform changes:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_phidata_ui.sh
   ```

2. Once deployed, use the provided URL to access the Phidata Agent UI

3. Follow the test scenarios in the testing guide to verify that:
   - The UI is properly deployed and accessible
   - The UI can connect to the backend API
   - Users can interact with different agents and tools
   - End-to-end functionality works as expected

4. Document any issues encountered during testing

```

The Phidata Agent UI connects to the Orchestra API, which handles agent processing, tool integration, and data storage. The UI service is configured to use the API's endpoint via the `PHIDATA_API_URL` environment variable.
