# LLM Error Handling in AI coordination System

This document describes the error handling approach for LLM providers and agents in the AI coordination System.

## Overview

The LLM components include robust error handling mechanisms to ensure system stability and graceful degradation when external LLM services encounter issues. The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Error Isolation**: LLM errors are contained and do not affect the broader system
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Appropriate fallback responses when LLM providers fail
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging
4. **Proper Resource Management**: Lifecycle handling through the unified service framework
5. **Configurable Retry Logic**: Customizable retry strategies for different error types

## Error Hierarchy

The system uses a comprehensive hierarchy of exception types:

```
LLMProviderError (base class)
├── LLMProviderAuthenticationError
├── LLMProviderConnectionError
├── LLMProviderRateLimitError
├── LLMProviderResourceExhaustedError
├── LLMProviderInvalidRequestError
├── LLMProviderServiceError
├── LLMProviderTimeoutError
└── LLMProviderModelError
```

This hierarchy enables specific error handling strategies for different error types.

## Retry Mechanism

The `LLMProvider` implementation includes configurable retry logic through the following mechanisms:

1. **Selective Retries**: Only certain error types are retried (configurable)
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delay between retry attempts
3. **Maximum Attempts**: Configurable limit on retry attempts
4. **Per-Provider Configuration**: Each provider can have its own retry settings

By default, the system retries:

- Connection errors
- Timeout errors
- Rate limit errors
- Service errors (server-side issues)

Authentication and invalid request errors are not retried by default as they require manual intervention.

## Fallback Responses

The `LLMAgent` provides graceful fallback responses for all error types, ensuring that end-users receive appropriate information when errors occur. These fallbacks:

1. Include persona-specific language for a consistent user experience
2. Provide appropriate confidence scores (lower for fallbacks)
3. Include detailed error metadata for logging and debugging
4. Use appropriate user-facing language based on error type

## Integration with Service Lifecycle

LLM components implement the `Service` interface from the unified registry framework, which provides:

1. Consistent initialization and shutdown
2. Proper resource management
3. Dependency tracking
4. Async/sync operation modes

This ensures that all LLM resources are properly managed throughout the application lifecycle.

## Client Configuration

The LLM provider configuration allows customization of:

- API keys and endpoints
- Default models
- Timeout settings
- Retry policies
- Retryable error types

This configuration is validated during initialization to ensure all required settings are present.

## Usage Example

Error handling in the LLM components is transparent to callers:

```python
try:
    # Normal agent processing
    response = await llm_agent.process(context)
    # Use the response...
except Exception as e:
    # Should never happen as errors are handled internally
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests for error handling in `tests/test_llm_error_handling.py`, covering:

1. Different error types
2. Retry behavior
3. Fallback responses
4. Resource management

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Circuit breaker pattern for temporary provider disabling
2. More sophisticated fallback strategies (e.g., trying alternative providers)
3. Enhanced monitoring and alerting for LLM errors
4. Dynamic retry policies based on error patterns
