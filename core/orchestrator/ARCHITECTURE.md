# AI Orchestration System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the AI Orchestration System, designed with a focus on modularity, clean separation of concerns, and extensibility.

## System Overview

The system consists of five main modules:

1. **Memory Module**: Handles storage and retrieval of conversation history
2. **Personas Module**: Manages AI agent personas with configurable traits
3. **Agents Module**: Provides the base agent functionality and agent registry
4. **Orchestrator Module**: Coordinates memory, personas, and agents components
5. **API Layer**: Exposes the system capabilities through RESTful endpoints

## Core Components

### Memory Module

The memory module provides a storage mechanism for conversation history and other relevant information.

Components:

- `MemoryItem`: Base class for items stored in memory
- `MemoryProvider`: Abstract interface for memory storage
- `InMemoryProvider`: Simple in-memory implementation
- `MemoryManager`: Central manager for memory operations

The memory system uses a provider pattern, allowing different storage backends to be implemented without changing the interface.

### Personas Module

The personas module manages AI agent personas with configurable traits and templates.

Components:

- `PersonaConfig`: Configuration for an AI persona
- `PersonaProcessor`: Applies persona-specific operations to responses
- `PersonaLoader`: Loads persona configurations from YAML
- `PersonaManager`: Central manager for persona operations

Personas are defined with traits, interaction styles, and templates that shape the character and tone of AI responses.

### Agents Module

The agents module defines the core agent interfaces and implementations.

Components:

- `AgentContext`: Context provided to agents for processing
- `AgentResponse`: Response from an agent's processing
- `Agent`: Abstract base class for all agents
- `SimpleTextAgent`: Basic implementation for text processing
- `PersonaAwareAgent`: Enhanced implementation with persona customization
- `AgentRegistry`: Registry for agent types

Agents use a plugin architecture where different agent types can be registered and selected dynamically based on context.

### Orchestrator Module

The orchestrator coordinates the memory, personas, and agents components to process user interactions.

Components:

- `EventEmitter`: Simple event system for orchestrator events
- `InteractionResult`: Result of an interaction processing
- `Orchestrator`: Main orchestrator for AI interactions

The orchestrator handles the complete interaction flow:

1. Select persona
2. Record user input in memory
3. Retrieve context from memory
4. Select appropriate agent
5. Generate response
6. Format response according to persona
7. Record response in memory
8. Return formatted response with metadata

### API Layer

The API layer exposes the system capabilities through RESTful endpoints.

Components:

- `InteractionRequest`: Request model for interaction API
- `InteractionResponse`: Response model for interaction API
- `PersonaInfo`: Persona information model
- `PersonaListResponse`: Response model for persona listing API

Endpoints:

- `POST /api/interact`: Process a user interaction
- `GET /api/personas`: List available personas
- `GET /api/health`: Health check endpoint

## Dependency Management

The system uses a factory pattern for dependency management, with singleton instances provided through getter functions:

- `get_memory_manager()`: Get global memory manager
- `get_persona_manager()`: Get global persona manager
- `get_agent_registry()`: Get global agent registry
- `get_orchestrator()`: Get global orchestrator

This pattern ensures that components are properly initialized and shared while avoiding circular dependencies.

## Event System

The system includes a simple event-based architecture for handling specific events:

- `interaction_started`: Fired when a new interaction begins
- `interaction_complete`: Fired when an interaction completes
- `interaction_error`: Fired when an error occurs during interaction

Events enable loose coupling between components and support extensibility through plugins.

## Extension Points

The system is designed to be extended in several ways:

1. **Custom MemoryProviders**: Implement the `MemoryProvider` interface for different storage backends (e.g., Redis, Firestore)
2. **Custom Agents**: Implement the `Agent` interface for specialized processing capabilities
3. **Enhanced Personas**: Define new persona templates in YAML configuration
4. **Event Handlers**: Subscribe to events to add custom processing logic

## Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a clear responsibility
2. **Dependency Injection**: Components receive their dependencies rather than creating them
3. **Interface-Based Design**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
4. **Lazy Initialization**: Resources are created only when needed
5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Components communicate through events rather than direct references

These principles ensure the system remains maintainable, extensible, and free from circular dependencies.
