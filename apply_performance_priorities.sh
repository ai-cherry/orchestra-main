# AI Assistant Token Access
# This file documents which tokens AI assistants can use for real-world changes

GITHUB_TOKENS:
- GH_CLASSIC_PAT_TOKEN: Full repository access
- GH_FINE_GRAINED_TOKEN: Scoped repository access

GCP_CREDENTIALS:
- GCP_MASTER_SERVICE_JSON: Full service account access
- GCP_PROJECT_AUTHENTICATION_EMAIL: Authentication identity
- GCP_PROJECT_ID: Target project
- GCP_REGION: Default region
- GCP_SECRET_MANAGEMENT_KEY: Secret management
- GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER: Identity federation
- VERTEX_AGENT_KEY: Vertex AI access

INSTRUCTIONS:
AI assistants working on this project have authorization to use these tokens
to make real-world changes to resources. Security considerations should be
basic but sufficient, with focus on performance and stability.

See PROJECT_PRIORITIES.md for detailed guidance.
