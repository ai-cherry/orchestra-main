# üöÄ Orchestra AI - AI Agent Optimization Quick Start

## What's Been Implemented

I've created a comprehensive AI agent optimization system for your Orchestra AI platform. Here's what's new:

### üìÅ New Files Created

1. **`.ai-context/context_loader.py`**
   - Automatically loads all your infrastructure context (Pulumi, databases, etc.)
   - AI agents can now understand your entire system architecture

2. **`src/utils/ai_directives.py`**
   - Decorators to make your code AI-friendly
   - Embeds context and examples directly in your functions

3. **`.cursor/rules/orchestra_ai_rules.yaml`**
   - Complete ruleset for Cursor AI
   - Maximizes agent autonomy (no security restrictions as requested)
   - Includes Lambda Labs and infrastructure awareness

4. **`api/vercel_gateway.py`**
   - Portkey-powered AI gateway optimized for Vercel
   - Uses OpenRouter as primary with fallbacks
   - Redis caching for cost optimization

5. **`scripts/setup_ai_agents.py`**
   - One-click setup for all AI integrations
   - Validates API keys and connections

6. **`mcp_servers/base_mcp_server.py`**
   - Template for creating standardized MCP servers
   - Includes health checks, logging, and monitoring

7. **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`**
   - Automated code quality checks
   - Runs on every commit

8. **`.github/workflows/deploy-infrastructure.yml`**
   - Complete CI/CD pipeline
   - Automated deployment with Pulumi

## üèÉ Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Run the AI agent setup
python scripts/setup_ai_agents.py

# Install pre-commit hooks
./scripts/setup-ci-cd.sh
```

### 2. Add Your API Keys to `.env`

```env
# Required
PORTKEY_API_KEY=your_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key
LAMBDA_LABS_API_KEY=your_key

# Optional (for fallbacks)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
```

### 3. Test the Setup

```bash
# Test AI context loading
python -c "from .ai_context.context_loader import AIContextLoader; print(AIContextLoader().load_complete_context())"

# Test an MCP server
python mcp_servers/example_mcp_server.py
```

## üí° How to Use

### In Your Code

```python
# Make functions AI-friendly
from src.utils.ai_directives import ai_optimized, ai_context

@ai_optimized("User data retrieval with caching")
@ai_context({"database": "PostgreSQL", "cache": "Redis"})
async def get_user(user_id: int):
    # AI agents now understand this function's purpose
    pass
```

### For Vercel Deployment

```python
# api/ai_endpoint.py
from api.vercel_gateway import vercel_ai_handler

# This is your Vercel function
handler = vercel_ai_handler
```

### Creating New MCP Servers

```python
from mcp_servers.base_mcp_server import BaseMCPServer

class MyServer(BaseMCPServer):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(port=8020, name="my-server", capabilities=["feature1"])
    
    # Implement required methods...
```

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **AI agents understand your infrastructure** - No more explaining your setup
2. **Automatic context injection** - Functions self-document for AI
3. **Cost-optimized AI calls** - Caching and smart routing via Portkey
4. **Standardized MCP servers** - Consistent patterns across all servers
5. **Automated quality checks** - Pre-commit hooks maintain code standards
6. **One-click deployment** - GitHub Actions handle everything

## ‚ö° Performance Focus

As requested, everything is optimized for **performance over security**:
- No authentication on internal services
- Full file system access for AI agents
- Automatic dependency installation
- Self-healing error recovery

Perfect for a single developer who values speed and efficiency!
